  content: "Born in 1975 (<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Essex\">Essex</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/English%20Artists\">England</a>), Tom &quot;Squarepusher&quot; Jenkinson's innovative work spans almost every musical genre, although he is perhaps best known for his experimental <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%27n%27bass\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">drum'n'bass</a> with a heavy <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jazz fusion</a> influence. Rising from near-total obscurity to drum'n'bass cause c\xC3\xA9l\xC3\xA8bre in the space of a couple of months, Jenkinson released only a pair of EPs and a DJ Food remix for the latter's Refried Food series before securing EP and LP release plans with three different labels. His first full-length work, Feed Me Weird Things (on Richard &quot;<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Aphex Twin</a>&quot; James' Rephlex label), was a dizzying, quixotic blend of superfast jungle breaks with Aphex-style synth textures, goofy, offbeat melodies, and instrumental arrangements (Jenkinson samples his own playing for his tracks) that recall vaguely <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jazz fusion</a> pioneers such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mahavishnu+Orchestra\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mahavishnu Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Weather+Report\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Weather Report</a>. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, Jenkinson's fretless accompaniment is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing).\n \n Jenkinson grew up listening to jazz and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dub\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">dub</a> greats like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Miles Davis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Augustus+Pablo\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Augustus Pablo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Charlie Parker</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Art Blakey</a>. The son of a jazz drummer, Jenkinson followed in his father's footsteps, playing bass and drums in high school. Introduced to electronic music through experimental <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electro\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">electro</a>-<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/techno\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">techno</a> artists such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/LFO\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">LFO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Craig\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Carl Craig</a>, Jenkinson soon began assembling the rolls of disparate influence into amalgams of breakbeat techno and post-bop avant-garde and progressive jazz. Claiming a closer affinity with jazz than <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jungle\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jungle</a> (although he draws from both equally in his music), Jenkinson's EPs as Squarepusher and the Duke of Harringay (Jenkinson moved to Harringay from his Chelmsford birthplace) were initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle's more obvious compositional principles, but found ready audience in fans of post-<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/acid%20house\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">acid house</a> experimental listening music. He inked a deal with Warp in 1995, releasing the Port Rhombus EP and three others through a variety of different labels. His full-length debut, Feed Me Weird Things, appeared in 1996, followed a year later by Hard Normal Daddy.\n \n Critical acclaim for Jenkinson's work peaked with 1998's Music Is Rotted One Note, for which he became a one-man fusion group -- multi-tracking himself playing drums, bass, and keyboards. The following year, he released two EPs (Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest) and another full LP, Selection Sixteen. Go Plastic appeared in summer 2001, featuring the closest thing to a hit Squarepusher had ever seen, with the single &quot;My Red Hot Car.&quot; Subsequent releases such as 2003's Do You Know Squarepusher and 2004's Ultravisitor found him refining his fusion of composition, programming, and musicianship.\n \n More recently, in 2008, Squarepusher released &quot;Just A Souvenir&quot;, in which he gives a more rock-influenced sound, using almost all organic instruments.\n \n Tom Jenkinson is also known as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+A.D.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chaos A.D.</a>\n \n His official website: <a href=\"http://www.squarepusher.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.squarepusher.net</a>\n "
