  summary: Ui (pronounced ooo-eee) was an American post-rock band based in New York City, which started in 1990 and ended mid-2000s. The group was started by Sasha Frere-Jones and Clem Waldmann, with Wilbo Wright joining the group in 1993. What set Ui apart from other post-rock groups was their emphasis on bass instead of guitar (Ui had two bass players). But besides their emphasis on bass, Ui also expanded their sound with supporting instruments; such as banjo, synthesizers, tuba and timpani (the group also had a high reliance on samplers and other studio equipment to flesh out their sound further).
