They consist of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Colin+Newman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Colin Newman</a> (vocals, guitar), <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Lewis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Graham Lewis</a> (vocals, bass) and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Gotobed\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Robert Gotobed</a> (drums). Founding guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Gilbert\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bruce Gilbert</a> left in 2004. In 2008, Margaret Fielder McGinnis of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Laika\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Laika</a> joined the band as their touring guitarist.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> emerged out of the British <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> explosion but, from the outset, maintained a distance from that scene and resisted easy categorization. While <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> rapidly became a caricature of itself, Wire's musical identity -- focused on experimentation and process -- was constantly metamorphosing. Their first three albums alone attest to a startling evolution as the band repeatedly reinvented itself between 1977 and 1979. That capacity for self-reinvention, coupled with a willingness to stop recording indefinitely when ideas weren't forthcoming, has been crucial to Wire's longevity and continued relevance.\n \n By the time of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a>, British art schools had long been a hotbed of musical activity, spawning some of the nation's most innovative <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> acts from the '60s onward. Like many <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> contemporaries, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> had roots in the art school tradition. At Watford Art College in 1976, guitarists Colin Newman and George Gill formed <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Overload\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Overload</a> with audiovisual technician Bruce Gilbert (also on guitar). Subsequently, the three recruited bassist Graham Lewis and drummer Robert Gotobed (aka Robert Grey), and the first <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> lineup was in place.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> began playing dates in London and, having ousted Gill, started from scratch, writing new material and taking a more pared-down, experimental approach. A gig at the Roxy in early 1977 proved auspicious. Wire met <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/EMI/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">EMI</a>'s Mike Thorne, who was recording groups for a live <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> album, The Roxy, London WC2. Thorne included two <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> tracks and was then instrumental in bringing the band to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/EMI/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">EMI</a> in September. By then, with Newman writing most of the music, they were eager to record before they lost interest in material, abandoned it, and moved on; a pattern that would define the group.\n \n Produced by Thorne, 1977's amphetamine-paced <a title=\"Wire - Pink Flag\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Pink+Flag\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pink Flag</a> found <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> taking <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> to extremes while also keeping an ironic distance from it by introducing elements of tension and abstraction. <a title=\"Wire - Pink Flag\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Pink+Flag\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pink Flag</a>'s 21 highly original tracks (each averaging just over a minute and a half) compressed and twisted rock into often jagged, taut shapes. The album met with critical acclaim and a follow-up was recorded in spring 1978.\n \n <a title=\"Wire - Chairs Missing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Chairs+Missing\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Chairs Missing</a> was a radical departure. Although the phrase &quot;early <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pink Floyd</a>&quot; was uttered dismissively in some quarters, it was well-received. With Thorne playing keyboards and producing, this was a more complex, multi-dimensional record that supplemented <a title=\"Wire - Pink Flag\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Pink+Flag\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pink Flag</a>'s harsh minimalism with dense, occasionally unsettling atmospherics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> albums usually feature one near-perfect pop song and <a title=\"Wire - Chairs Missing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Chairs+Missing\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Chairs Missing</a>'s &quot;<a title=\"Wire &ndash; Outdoor Miner\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/_/Outdoor+Miner\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Outdoor Miner</a>&quot; almost became a hit, until it was scuppered by a payola scandal at <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/EMI/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">EMI</a>.\n \n This was an enormously creative phase. Songs were being written and jettisoned at a considerable rate and the band was gigging relentlessly. In summer 1978, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> played in the U.S. for the first time and, in March 1979, toured Europe with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Roxy Music</a>. Although <a title=\"Wire - Chairs Missing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Chairs+Missing\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Chairs Missing</a> had been released only months before, live sets included a significant amount of material that would appear on <a title=\"Wire - 154\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/154\" class=\"bbcode_album\">154</a>. Indeed, Wire often tended to bewilder live audiences by playing new, unrecorded tracks rather than the numbers people expected to hear.\n \n If <a title=\"Wire - Chairs Missing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Chairs+Missing\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Chairs Missing</a> saw <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> exploring the possibilities offered by the recording studio, on <a title=\"Wire - 154\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/154\" class=\"bbcode_album\">154</a> they took fuller advantage of that environment. With Lewis emerging as a vocalist alongside Newman, the result was an expansive, textured album with a more pronounced melodic orientation. <a title=\"Wire - 154\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/154\" class=\"bbcode_album\">154</a> was <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>'s most accomplished statement to date and the group seemed poised for success. The opposite happened. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>'s relationship with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/EMI/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">EMI</a> unraveled and they were soon label-less. In February 1980 at London's Electric Ballroom, the band played an infamously chaotic show (captured on Document and Eyewitness) that was more like performance art than a rock performance. A five-year hiatus ensued\n \n Following a period of intense activity away from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>, the members regrouped in 1985, referring to their new incarnation as a &quot;beat combo&quot; -- a no-nonsense, stripped-down unit. The 1986 &quot;comeback&quot; EP, <a title=\"Wire - Snakedrill\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Snakedrill\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Snakedrill</a>, begat &quot;<a title=\"Wire &ndash; Drill\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/_/Drill\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Drill</a>,&quot; a track built on a paradigmatic <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> rhythm, which bridged the gap between the group's past and its present. &quot;<a title=\"Wire &ndash; Drill\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/_/Drill\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Drill</a>&quot; would stand as an evolving metaphor for the band's shifting identity. It mutated through multiple versions, changing from performance to performance. (In 1991, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> would release <a title=\"Wire - The Drill\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/The+Drill\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Drill</a>, an album composed entirely of versions of the track.)\n \n The bandmembers' solo endeavors during the early '80s proved crucial to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>'s new direction: the avant-pop sensibility developed by Newman on his albums and the experimental inclinations of Lewis and Gilbert were channeled into the nascent digital context in which the band was now working. <a title=\"Wire - The Ideal Copy\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/The+Ideal+Copy\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Ideal Copy</a> (1987), the first full-length example of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>'s new approach to the processes of composition and recording with sequencing technology, found the group's smart, state-of-the-art grooves skirting the dancefloor. While first-generation fans were glad to have Wire back, their new sound drew a new audience in the U.S. and an American tour followed. They continued in an electronically oriented direction with the more homogeneous <a title=\"Wire - A Bell Is a Cup...Until It Is Struck\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/A+Bell+Is+a+Cup...Until+It+Is+Struck\" class=\"bbcode_album\">A Bell Is a Cup...Until It Is Struck</a>(1988), whose combination of hypnotic, melodic patterns and impenetrable yet catchy lyrics made for surreal, brainy pop.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> had already made one of rock's more unorthodox live records but they further deconstructed the clich\xC3\xA9 of the &quot;live album&quot; for 1989's <span title=\"Unknown album\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">It's Beginning to &amp;Back Again</span>. Performance recordings were stripped down in the studio, sometimes to a drumbeat or a baseline, which was then used as the starting point for rebuilding the track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> continued to experiment with ways of letting studio technologies affect their creative process on <a title=\"Wire - Manscape\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Manscape\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Manscape</a> (1990), which forayed deeper into computer-based electronics and programming. Drummer Robert Gotobed was less enthusiastic about changing his role in the developing digital version of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> and left the band just before a 1990 tour. Dropping the &quot;e&quot; from the group's name, Gilbert, Lewis, and Newman carried on as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/WIR\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">WIR</a>, releasing <a title=\"Wire - The First Letter\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/The+First+Letter\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The First Letter</a>. In 1992, another hiatus began and the three returned to their diverse solo ventures.\n \n In the '80s, American bands like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">R.E.M.</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Black\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Big Black</a> had covered <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> songs. By the mid-'90s, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a>'s influence started to manifest itself among a younger generation of Britpop artists, most notoriously <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elastica\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Elastica</a>, whose appropriation of <a title=\"Wire - Pink Flag\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Pink+Flag\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pink Flag</a>'s &quot;<a title=\"Wire &ndash; Three Girl Rhumba\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/_/Three+Girl+Rhumba\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Three Girl Rhumba</a>&quot; resulted in a settlement between the groups' respective music publishing companies. Having briefly resurfaced with Robert Gotobed in 1996 for a performance of &quot;<a title=\"Wire &ndash; Drill\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/_/Drill\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Drill</a>&quot; to celebrate Bruce Gilbert's 50th birthday, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> remained silent until 1999, when they began rehearsing again. In 2000, the band played live in the U.K. (including an event at London's Royal Festival Hall) and completed a U.S. tour; unpredictable as ever, Wire performed almost exclusively old numbers.\n \n Although reworkings of older tracks taped during 1999 rehearsals appeared on <a title=\"Wire - The Third Day\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/The+Third+Day\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Third Day</a> (2000) (with Robert Gotobed now returned to the band), <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> soon initiated their next phase. Completely new material appeared in the form of 2002's <span title=\"Unknown album\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Read &amp;Burn</span>, the first in a projected series of releases to be developed at Newman's Swim studios. While the fast, loud menace of <a title=\"Wire - Read &amp; Burn\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Read%2B%2526%2BBurn\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Read &amp; Burn</a> 01 harked back to <a title=\"Wire - Pink Flag\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Pink+Flag\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pink Flag</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wire</a> sounded more like they were stomping all over their roots than nostalgically returning to them. A second Read &amp; Burn was out by the end of the year; Send, a full-length containing brand new songs and <a title=\"Wire - Read &amp; Burn\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Read%2B%2526%2BBurn\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Read &amp; Burn</a> material, was released in May of 2003. In 2004, Bruce Gilbert left the band, but the band continued, releasing their latest album, <a title=\"Wire - Object 47\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/Object+47\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Object 47</a> in July 2008."
