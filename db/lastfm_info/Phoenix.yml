Formed in 1999, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Phoenix\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Phoenix</a> became an underground hit with the loungy, mellow and unpretentious sound heard on their 2000 debut album <em>United</em>. Their biggest hits, &quot;Too Young&quot; and  &quot;If I Ever Feel Better&quot; (major hit in France) propelled the album to enough success to grant the band a contract for a second album, <em>Alphabetical</em>, released in 2004. The four Parisians have since released a new album called <em>It's Never Been Like That</em>. The album contains ten new songs. Thomas Hedlund from<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/the+perishers\"> the Perishers </a> played drums during their last recording and tour.\n <a href=\"http://www.wearephoenix.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wearephoenix.com</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/wearephoenix\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.myspace.com/wearephoenix</a>\n \n \n Phoenix <strong>[II]</strong>: progressive/folk rock band from Romania formed in 1962, still active. At some points also recorded as Sym-Phoenix and Transsylvania-Phoenix. Their music, with a strong Romanian traditional background and an obvious pro-freedom, anti-totalitary character was not exactly on the taste of the Romanian communist regime. In 1978, all Phoenix members except for Mircea Baniciu, the lead vocal, left the country in a dangerous escape, hidden in the large speakers they used in their concerts, placed in a truck, while the only member who could leave the country was driving the truck. The band continued its activity outside Romania, although not with the same success. After the Romanian revolution 1989, Phoenix returned and continued to give concerts. Their latest album, <em>Baba Novak</em>, featuring new songs as well as old, unreleased songs, was quite successful, and Phoenix still has an important place in the Romanian rock scene.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Phoenix+(Symphoenix)\">http://www.last.fm/music/Phoenix+(Symphoenix)</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.transsylvania-phoenix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.transsylvania-phoenix.com/</a>\n \n \n Phoenix <strong>[III]</strong>: UK band (1976-1980) featuring John Verity, Jim Rodford, and Bob Henrit from the band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Argent\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Argent</a>.\n \n Phoenix <strong>[IV]</strong>: released an album called <em>Play Thing</em> in 1991.
