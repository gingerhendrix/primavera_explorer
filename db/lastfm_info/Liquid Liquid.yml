  summary: "Liquid Liquid was a New York City post-punk band that was active from 1980 to 1983. Their track &quot;Cavern&quot;, from the Optimo EP, recorded by Don Hunerberg was sampled (actually played by the Sugar Hill house band) on <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Grandmaster+Flash\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Grandmaster Flash</a> and Melle Mel's &quot;White Lines (Don't Do It)&quot;. Since the band\xE2\x80\x99s inception in 1980, the sounds of Liquid Liquid have haunted the clubs. The original records were pressed in very limited quantities on the 99 label, and can now fetch high prices. Though the pressings were small the impact the music has made is lasting and far reaching."

Since the band\xE2\x80\x99s inception in 1980, the sounds of Liquid Liquid have haunted the clubs. The original records were pressed in very limited quantities on the 99 label, and can now fetch high prices. Though the pressings were small the impact the music has made is lasting and far reaching. The first three EPs, plus live material, were reissued in 1997 by Grand Royal (US) and Mo' Wax (UK). After the collapse of both these labels, Domino Records released the music from all three original 12&quot;s plus extra tracks and early live recordings as Slip In And Out Of Phenomenon in 2008. Their music was essentially groove based, influenced by the many different sources, funk, dub reggae of the 1970s, and primarily punk in its do it yourself garage approach.\n \n Scott Hartley, Richard McGuire, Salvatore Principato and Dennis Young were the band members. Dennis Young is still active and producing music, and has been remixed by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Chip\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Hot Chip</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tussle\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tussle</a>. Richard McGuire is well-established graphic designer with frequent contributions to both The New Yorker magazine, and The New York Times Book Review. Salvatore Principato is active in various electronic music recording projects, as well as DJ'ing professionally around the world."
