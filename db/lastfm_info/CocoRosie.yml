  content: "<strong>CocoRosie</strong> began in Paris, France and formed by Sierra Casady (Rosie) and Bianca Casady (Coco) in 2003. Sierra and Bianca Casady are North American half-Cherokee sisters. Sierra, the older of the two, was born in Iowa, and Bianca was born in Hawaii. Their mother nicknamed them Rosie and Coco, respectively, from which their musical act takes its name. \n \n In 2003, Bianca was growing restless and decided it was time for a change. She left her apartment in Brooklyn to travel the world. Unexpectedly, she showed up at Sierra's apartment in Paris.\n \n Over the course of the next two months, the women spent nearly every waking hour in Sierra's bathroom, chosen as the most acoustic and isolated room in the apartment. Soon, they had completed both a hip hop recording (never released) called &quot;word to the crow&quot; and their proper debut album La maison de mon r\xC3\xAAve.\n \n Originally, La maison de mon r\xC3\xAAve was only intended to be distributed among a close circle of friends. However, by 2004 the lo-fi album was released on independent label Touch and Go Records, who had obtained a copy of the CD and had uncharacteristically pursued signing the artists. Since the creation of their first album, the Casady sisters have been virtually inseparable.\n \n Stylistically they may be assigned to the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">indie rock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/psych%20folk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">psych folk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/folk-tronic\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">folk-tronic</a> genres, and are sometimes associated with the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20weird%20america\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">new weird america</a> movement. Sierra, who studied operatic vocal techniques, does the lead vocals and also plays guitar, harp and flute. Bianca is a percussionist and also beatboxes. The group also uses various objects such as toys to construct their unique sound.\n \n \n They were actively touring in most of 2004, playing across the U.S. and throughout Europe with artists such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/TV+on+the+Radio\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">TV on the Radio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Eyes\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bright Eyes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Battles\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Battles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Devendra+Banhart\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Devendra Banhart</a>, Busdriver among others.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.cocorosieland.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocorosieland.com</a>"
