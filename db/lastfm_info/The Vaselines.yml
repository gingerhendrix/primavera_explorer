    The Vaselines were an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 1986, the band was originally made up of only Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretty+Flowers" class="bbcode_artist">The Pretty Flowers</a> with Duglas T. Stewart, Norman Blake and Sean Dickson. Eugene had formerly played in 'The Famous Monsters'.
    
     <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his &quot;most favorite songwriters in the whole world&quot;.
    
     The band released two singles, &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Son of a Gun" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Son+of+a+Gun" class="bbcode_track">Son of a Gun</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Dying for It" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Dying+for+It" class="bbcode_track">Dying for It</a>&quot;, prior to releasing an album. In 1989 they released their only album, <a title="The Vaselines - Dum Dum" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/Dum+Dum" class="bbcode_album">Dum Dum</a>, on the record label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Rough+Trade/" class="bbcode_label">Rough Trade</a>. Following the closing of the record label <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">53rd and 3rd</span>, which they had originally signed to, the band broke up in 1990. However, they reunited later that year to open for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> when they played in Edinburgh.
    
     Though they were not widely known when the band existed, covers of their songs by Nirvana and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain" class="bbcode_artist">Kurt Cobain</a>'s tendency to mention them as an influence brought exposure to the band. With their songs &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Molly's Lips" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Molly%27s+Lips" class="bbcode_track">Molly's Lips</a>&quot; covered on Nirvana's album Incesticide and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Jesus+Wants+Me+For+A+Sunbeam" class="bbcode_track">Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam</a>&quot; covered as &quot;Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam&quot; on MTV Unplugged in New York, the band gained a new audience from people who wanted to discover the bands that influenced Cobain (a similar situation happened to the band The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Puppets" class="bbcode_artist">Meat Puppets</a>). Due to this new exposure, in 1992 <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop/" class="bbcode_label">Sub Pop</a> released <a title="The Vaselines - The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/The+Way+of+the+Vaselines%3A+A+Complete+History" class="bbcode_album">The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History</a>, a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work on one album.
    
     No longer together, members of the band moved on to new bands. Kelly went on to found the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Captain+America" class="bbcode_artist">Captain America</a> (later renamed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eugenius" class="bbcode_artist">Eugenius</a>). He currently performs solo. McKee founded the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Suckle" class="bbcode_artist">Suckle</a> and released her first solo album, Sunny Moon, in 2006.
