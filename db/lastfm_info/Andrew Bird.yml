    <strong>Andrew Bird</strong> (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">singer-songwriter</a>, a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/violinist" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">violinist</a> and, since 2004, a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">guitarist</a>. He also is an accomplished whistler.
    
     His early work, which echoed of gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.
    
     Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, <em>Music of Hair</em>, in 1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">folk</a> traditions, as well as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">jazz</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/blues" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">blues</a>.
    
     His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Squirrel+Nut+Zippers" class="bbcode_artist">Squirrel Nut Zippers</a>. He was quickly lumped in with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/swing" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">swing</a> craze that swept the <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/United+States" class="bbcode_place">United States</a> music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.
    
     Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird%27s+Bowl+of+Fire" class="bbcode_artist">Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire</a>, he released the album <em>Thrills</em>. This was followed by <em>Oh! The Grandeur</em> in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">folk</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/pre-war%20jazz" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">pre-war jazz</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/swing" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">swing</a>, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.
    
     In 2001, Bird released <em>The Swimming Hour</em>, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. <em>The Swimming Hour</em> featured a mixture of styles, from the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/zydeco" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">zydeco</a>-influenced &quot;Core and Rind&quot; to more straightforward <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">rock</a> songs. He has often referred to this record as his &quot;jukebox album&quot;.
    
     The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Rudy+Day" class="bbcode_artist">Mr. Rudy Day</a>), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.
    
     Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ani+DiFranco" class="bbcode_artist">Ani DiFranco</a>, <a href="http://www.righteousbabe.com/" rel="nofollow">Righteous Babe Records</a>. The two records, 2003's <em>Weather Systems</em> and 2005's <em>The Mysterious Production of Eggs</em>, continue a progression towards an eclectic <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">indie folk</a> sound that has proven challenging to classify.
    
     Bird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a &quot;loop&quot; of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.
    
     Bird's latest full-lenth album <em>Armchair Apocrypha</em> (<a href="http://fatpossum.com/albums.php" rel="nofollow">Fat Possum</a>) was released on March 20th 2007.
    
     November 2007 saw the <em>Soldier On EP</em> originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, &quot;The Trees Were Mistaken&quot;, a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Oh Sister&quot;.
    
     January 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.
