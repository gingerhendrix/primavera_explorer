  content: "Bloc Party are an English <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">indie rock</a> band. In 2005, the band released their critically acclaimed debut album <a title=\"Bloc Party - Silent Alarm\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/Silent+Alarm\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Silent Alarm</a>. Their second studio album, <a title=\"Bloc Party - A Weekend in the City\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/A+Weekend+in+the+City\" class=\"bbcode_album\">A Weekend in the City</a> was released on February 5, 2007 in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United Kingdom</a> and February 6 in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+States\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United States</a>. A third album, <a title=\"Bloc Party - Intimacy\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/Intimacy\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Intimacy</a>, was released in August 2008 as a download and later as a CD release on October 27. The band consists of Kele Okereke (vocals, guitar), Russell Lissack (guitar), Gordon Moakes (bass, vocals) and Matt Tong (drums).\n \n Formation and rising popularity (2006\xE2\x80\x932008)\n \n Bloc Party have been together since 2002, with names such as Superheroes of BMX, The Angel Range, Diet, and Union, before settling on Bloc Party in September 2003. Band members <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kele+Okereke\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kele Okereke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Russell+Lissack\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Russell Lissack</a> have formed the fulcrum of these various incarnations, and were subsequently joined by bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gordon+Moakes\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gordon Moakes</a> who answered an advert in the NME, and most recently drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Tong\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Matt Tong</a>. Lissack and singer/guitarist Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in Essex, where Lissack had grown up and Okereke attended school. Lissack attended Bancroft's School and Okereke attended Ilford County High School until 16 then Trinity School for sixth form. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at the Reading Festival and soon after formed the band Union.\n \n In 2003 they changed their name from Union to Bloc Party. The name is a play on block party, a name for an informal neighbourhood festival, which might hire a local band as entertainment. The band have said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Qu\xC3\xA9b\xC3\xA9cois; the absence of a 'k' is purely for aesthetics.\n \n However, the band's bassist, Gordon Moakes, said on the group's official internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern &quot;blocs&quot; and the western &quot;parties&quot;, in the political sense. Moakes notes that the name was not driven by politics, but rather it &quot;looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it.&quot;\n \n In November 2003, Bloc Party had their track &quot;The Marshalls Are Dead&quot; featured on a compilation CD called The New Cross released by Angular Recording Corporation. Soon after they released their debut single &quot;She's Hearing Voices&quot; on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics.\n \n The band got their break after Okereke went to a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Ferdinand\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Franz Ferdinand</a> concert in 2003, and was able to thrust a copy of the single into the hands of both Franz lead singer Alex Kapranos and Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show, labeling the track &quot;genius&quot;, and invited them to record a live session for the show.\n \n The buzz generated off the back of the single sparked some A&amp;R interest, leading to another single &quot;Banquet&quot;, this time released by the label Moshi Moshi, and to the eventual signing with indie label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.\n \n Bloc Party's own variation of spiky guitar rock draws on influences such as The Cure, Gang of Four, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Pixies, Joy Division, and XTC, but the band says that some of these bands are just comparisons.\n \n The drumming on Bloc Party songs is often influenced by the London dance and R&amp;B scene whilst the guitar demonstrates typical indie sharpness with alternative panned chords and fast chord picking. To achieve their unique guitar style, BOSS echo effects equipment is implemented and is particularly apparent on the track &quot;Like Eating Glass&quot;.\n \n The musical style of A Weekend in the City is more varied, however, drawing influence particularly from more expansive sounding bands, including Radiohead.\n \n \n Silent Alarm (2004\xE2\x80\x932006)\n \n Their debut album Silent Alarm, released in February 2005, was met with critical acclaim and broke sales records, being voted by NME critics as the 2005 album of the year and reaching #3 on UK album charts (selling platinum in the UK). The second single from the album &quot;So Here We Are&quot; made the top 5 on UK charts. Further singles &quot;Banquet&quot; (which reached #13 in NME's &quot;Top 50 singles of 2005&quot;), &quot;Helicopter&quot; (which featured on the FIFA 06, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, Project Gotham Racing 3, Burnout Revenge and Guitar Hero III game soundtracks) and &quot;Pioneers&quot; (July 2005), whilst failing to repeat this success, managed to make dents in the UK top 20. The animated video for the single &quot;Pioneers&quot; was number one in the NME video charts for 4 weeks and was made for a tiny budget in four weeks by the Shoreditch based Mini Vegas design agency.\n \n Even though the band was met with good reviews from critics in America, Bloc Party failed to break through to the pop or rock charts in the US.\n \n Bloc Party became one of the most popular new bands of 2005, and the established electronic group <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Chemical Brothers</a> soon collaborated with Okereke for &quot;Believe&quot;, a track on the Brothers' Push the Button album.\n \n An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm was released at the end of August in the UK. This remix album, Silent Alarm Remixed, retained the album's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet and Mogwai.\n \n During July, they recorded two new tracks (titles were given of &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Two More Years&quot;) with Silent Alarm producer Paul Epworth. The latter, &quot;Two More Years&quot; was released on October 3 to coincide with their October 2005 UK tour. The songs were released as an EP titled Two More Years, accompanied with a re-release of Silent Alarm, which included &quot;Two More Years&quot; itself along with former single &quot;Little Thoughts&quot;. The single format of &quot;Two More Years&quot; contained a remix of &quot;Banquet&quot; done by The Streets, for which a video was also recorded.\n \n The band also contributed the track &quot;The Present&quot; to the Help: a Day in the Life compilation, the profits of which benefits the War Child charity.\n \n The single &quot;Banquet&quot; was sampled in 2006 by DJ Green Lantern for a track with Apathy, Tak (of rap duo Styles of Beyond) and Mike Shinoda. The track, entitled &quot;Bloc Party&quot;, appears on Green Lantern's Fort Minor: We Major mixtape.\n \n A Weekend in the City (2006\xE2\x80\x932008)\n \n The band released their second album, called A Weekend in the City on February 5, 2007 in the UK and February 6 in the United States. The album debuted at #12 in the Billboard 200 with 48,000 copies sold. It became available via the UK's iTunes store a day ahead of schedule, on February 4, and reached the #2 spot in the Official UK Chart. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee. The first single, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, was released on January 29. This single had been located on their MySpace since November 22, 2006. The next single, &quot;I Still Remember&quot;, is their first American single. In the build up to the release of the album, Zane Lowe aired a live set from Maida Vale featuring a mix of old songs and new ones on his evening radio show on BBC Radio 1 on January 30, 2007. On February 1, 2007, A Weekend in the City was made available to listen to for free through the band's official MySpace page.\n \n The band's first gig following the release of AWITC was on February 5 at Reading Hexagon. It was broadcasted live on BBC's Music Station 6 Music that night as well.\n \n Bloc Party played in the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 and T in the Park and the Oxegen Festival that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals 2007. \n \n On 27th October, Bloc Party showed &quot;Flux&quot; to the world at their gig during the BBC Electric Proms, and on November 12th, they released the single. It charted well, reaching #8 in the UK charts, and was well received both by critics and fans, despite the new electronic direction.\n \n Intimacy (2008-present)\n \n On 7th July, Bloc Party premiered new track &quot;Mercury&quot; on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show following a countdown timer on Bloc Party's website. The track took a bold new direction, moving away from guitar rock, with an experimental electronic sound. The track charted at #16 in the UK charts when it was released as a single on the 11th of August.\n \n On the 18th of August, in a webcam chat with fans, they announced that their third album, Intimacy, would be released for download on their website on the 21st of August. The album contained \n On the 23rd and 24th of August, Bloc Party played second headliners before The Killers at <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/event/432551\" class=\"bbcode_event\">Reading</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/event/455250\" class=\"bbcode_event\">Leeds Festivals</a>, opening their set with &quot;Mercury&quot;, and also playing &quot;One Month Off&quot; from their new album. They also played an entirely unplanned encore of &quot;She's Hearing Voices&quot;. \n \n The album Intimacy was released in physical formats on October 27th, featuring additional tracks, such as current single &quot;Talons&quot;.\n \n Trivia:\n \n * The track &quot;Song For Clay (Disappear Here)&quot; is a reference/tribute song to the book <em>Less Than Zero</em> by Bret Easton Ellis and serves as the point of view of the book's main character, Clay Easton.\n \n * The band's live television d\xC3\xA9but was &quot;Helicopter&quot; on the Later with Jools Holland show. In the US, their live television d\xC3\xA9but was on the Late Show with David Letterman, playing &quot;Banquet&quot;.\n \n * The band was on tour with Panic! at the Disco in November-December, 2006. However, they dropped out early in the tour after drummer Matt Tong was admitted to hospital when his lung collapsed during a show in Atlanta on November 9, 2006. Although he quickly recovered, he was advised to rest and so the band dropped out of the tour.\n \n * Bloc Party's largest headlining show was played at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, California on August 3, 2006 with Mew, Two Gallants and Broken Social Scene opening.\n \n * Lead singer Kele embarrassed himself while playing at the Oxegen festival in Ireland in 2005. He declared to the Irish crowd that he was &quot;glad to be back in the UK&quot;. The comment was met with good humour, and a joking &quot;BOO&quot; from the crowd.\n \n * During their Toronto show on March 25th, 2007, lead singer of Broken Social Scene Kevin Drew came out on stage to sing vocals for the track &quot;So Here We Are&quot;.\n \n * Their debut song &quot;This Modern Love&quot; appeared on the final episode of the first season of the popular sitcom series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.\n \n * The track 'I Still Remember' was featured on three episodes of the hit T.V series &quot;The O.C&quot; and in the movie &quot;Prom Night&quot;.\n \n * The track 'Kreuzberg' featured in the second to last episode of the TV series &quot;The O.C&quot;.\n \n * The track SXRT was featured on the episode &quot;The Other Side of This Life (Part 2)&quot; of Grey's Anatomy.\n   \n * The track 'The Prayer' was featured in the episode, &quot;The Prophet&quot; in the series Kyle XY.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.blocparty.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.blocparty.com</a>"
