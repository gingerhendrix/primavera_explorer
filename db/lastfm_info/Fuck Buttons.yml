They released their first album, Street Horrrsing, in 2008 and received widespread acclaim. A single, &quot;Colours Move&quot;, followed later that year.\n \n Their second album 'Tarot Sport' was released in October 2009.\n \n &quot;The album, \xE2\x80\x98Tarot Sport\xE2\x80\x99, is one of unbound possibility and lucid cohesion; a cerebral pilgrimage that refines, crafts, explores and develops the experimental aesthetic of last year\xE2\x80\x99s critically acclaimed debut, \xE2\x80\x98Street Horrrsing.\xE2\x80\x99&quot; ATP\n \n The duo\xE2\x80\x99s pioneering sound drew legendary DJ, producer and remixer Andrew Weatherall into the story - his own unique ethos inspired him to return behind the desk at the Rotters Golf Club Studio in London to capture a snapshot of two artists pushing forward into uncharted territories. As the band say, \xE2\x80\x9CThere are so many more layers of sound that we needed somebody with the ability to spread these out over a wide plane\xE2\x80\xA6 The ambition of sound in this record required him to realise it.\xE2\x80\x9D \n \n The seven tracks on the album reflect a new-found complexity of sound that Fuck Buttons immersed themselves in, strived for and achieved with startling results.\n \n All of Fuck Buttons' design work is created by the band themselves, Andrew makes the videos whilst Benjamin designs the record sleeves \xE2\x80\x93 embellishing one cohesive identity throughout their output.\n \n \n "
