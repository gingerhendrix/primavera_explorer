    <strong>Neil Young</strong> was born in Toronto, Ontario, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Canada" class="bbcode_place">Canada</a> on November 12, 1945. He is a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">singer-songwriter</a> with a long and extensive musical career. He has become one of the most respected and influential musicians of his generation.
    
     Neil started his professional music career in the mid-1960's with a number of bands in Canada, notably the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mynah+Birds" class="bbcode_artist">Mynah Birds</a>, which also included fellow future <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Buffalo+Springfield" class="bbcode_artist">Buffalo Springfield</a> bassist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Palmer" class="bbcode_artist">Bruce Palmer</a> and future funk star <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+James" class="bbcode_artist">Rick James</a>. When the Mynah Birds broke up, Young and Palmer headed to California to meet <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Stills" class="bbcode_artist">Stephen Stills</a>, whom he had met in Thunder Bay, and the result was <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Buffalo+Springfield" class="bbcode_artist">Buffalo Springfield</a>. That band split up after three albums, and Neil soon started his solo career with the release of <em><a title="Neil Young - Neil Young" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Neil+Young" class="bbcode_album">Neil Young</a></em>  November 12, 1968. The album did not do very well commercially, but included several strong tracks, including &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; The Loner" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/The+Loner" class="bbcode_track">The Loner</a></em>&quot;, said to be a portrait of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Stills" class="bbcode_artist">Stephen Stills</a>. On May 14, 1969 he recruited  <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Crazy%2BHorse">Crazy Horse</a> and made the critically acclaimed <em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/Everybody+Knows+This+Is+Nowhere" class="bbcode_album">Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</a></em>. This was a much more consistent album,  the first to introduce longstanding collaborators Crazy Horse, and built around the balanced interplay between the guitars of Young, and the talented Danny Whitten.  The album also featured two lengthy classics, &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse &ndash; Down By The River" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/_/Down+By+The+River" class="bbcode_track">Down By The River</a></em>&quot; and &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse &ndash; Cowgirl In The Sand" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/_/Cowgirl+In+The+Sand" class="bbcode_track">Cowgirl In The Sand</a></em>&quot;, but it was <em><a title="Neil Young - Harvest" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Harvest" class="bbcode_album">Harvest</a></em> in 1972 that would make Neil Young into a well-known star with his first solo hit &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Heart of Gold" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Heart+of+Gold" class="bbcode_track">Heart of Gold</a></em>&quot;.
    
     During this time he also enjoyed considerable success as a quarter of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Crosby%252C%2BStills%252C%2BNash%2B%2526%2BYoung" class="bbcode_artist">Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young</a>. 
    
     Neil's subsequent work has zig-zagged across genres - dabbling in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">country rock</a> on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Old Ways" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Old+Ways" class="bbcode_track">Old Ways</a></em>&quot;; electronics on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Trans" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Trans" class="bbcode_track">Trans</a></em>&quot;; hooking up with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shocking+Pinks" class="bbcode_artist">Shocking Pinks</a> in a homage to old-time Rock 'n' Roll on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Everybody's Rockin'" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Everybody%27s+Rockin%27" class="bbcode_track">Everybody's Rockin'</a></em>&quot;; creating a wall of feedback on the live <em>Arc-Weld</em>; and cementing his status as Godfather of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">grunge</a> when collaborating with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam" class="bbcode_artist">Pearl Jam</a> on <em><a title="Pearl Jam - Mirrorball" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/Mirrorball" class="bbcode_album">Mirrorball</a></em>.
    
     His idiosyncratic approach to genre even led to him being sued by his record company (<a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Geffen/" class="bbcode_label">Geffen</a>) in the 80's for making &quot;uncharacteristic&quot; music.
    
     Young has also dabbled in film, most recently on the album/concert series/dvd <em><a title="Neil Young - Greendale" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Greendale" class="bbcode_album">Greendale</a></em>. 
    
     60 years and still going strong the very special and often strange Neil Young keeps on making music. His latest release is <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Chrome+Dreams+II">Chrome Dreams II.</a></em> 
    
     The film Canadian Bacon includes the line &quot;Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to ruin our lives. The metric system, for the love of God! Celsius! Neil Young!&quot;
