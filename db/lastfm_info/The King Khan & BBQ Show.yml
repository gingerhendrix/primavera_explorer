    The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show is a Canadian <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/garage%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">garage rock</a> duo from Montreal, Quebec. The band is comprised of former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Spaceshits" class="bbcode_artist">The Spaceshits</a> bandmates <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Sultan" class="bbcode_artist">Mark Sultan</a> and Blacksnake. Mark Sultan, under the pseudonym <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/BBQ" class="bbcode_artist">BBQ</a>, contributes vocals, guitar, tambourine, bass drum, and snare drum; while Blacksnake, currently using the pseudonym King Khan, provides lead guitar and vocals.
     
     Both BBQ and King Khan had previously collaborated together while the two were members of the Montreal-based Spaceshits, however, following a European tour, Blacksnake (the then-current alias of King Khan) opted to remain in Germany on a permanent basis, resulting in the ultimate breakup of the Spaceshits, who chose not to continue without Blacksnake. Following the breakup of the Spaceshits, Mark Sultan started another Montreal-based band, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Sexareenos" class="bbcode_artist">Les Sexareenos</a>, before venturing off on his own as a one-man band under the pseudonym BBQ. It was as BBQ that Mark Sultan re-established contact with Blacksnake, playing alongside Blacksnake's new band, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/King%2BKhan%2B%2526%2BThe%2BShrines" class="bbcode_artist">King Khan &amp; The Shrines</a>. The two began writing songs together at Blacksnake's apartment in Germany, playing them live at sporadic shows around Germany and Spain.
     
     In 2004 the band recorded their first album as the King Khan &amp; BBQ Show, releasing &quot;The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show LP&quot; in America on Goner Records, and on Hazelwood Records in Europe. The album was recorded by DM Bob in Hamburg, Germany. In support of the album, the band began a world tour, with stops in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the US and South America. In 2006 the band released their second LP, &quot;<a title="The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show - What's For Dinner?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The%2BKing%2BKhan%2B%2526%2BBBQ%2BShow/What%27s+For+Dinner%3F" class="bbcode_album">What's For Dinner?</a>&quot;, on In the Red Records.
