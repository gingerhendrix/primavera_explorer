  content: "Simian Mobile Disco are an English <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dance\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">dance</a> production and remix team. Formed from the ashes of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Simian\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Simian</a> in 2005, Simian Mobile Disco comprises James Ellis Ford and James Anthony Shaw. They have released a number of low profile singles, such as &quot;The Count&quot; on Kitsune Records, but have arguably gained more fame for their remixes of artists such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go%21+Team\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Go! Team</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Air\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Air</a> and others.\n \n In the late \xE2\x80\x9890s, James Ford and Jas Shaw were studying biology and philosophy, respectively, at <span title=\"Unknown place\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Manchester</span> University, while making electronic music in the spare room of their shared house. Fellow student Simon Lord, a folk-influenced singer-songwriter, caught wind of the duo\xE2\x80\x99s sonic experiments, and along with bass player Alex MacNaughten they formed the band Simian.\n \n In order to sate their love of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic%20party\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">electronic party</a> music, James and Jas booked some DJ dates while touring with Simian, calling themselves Simian Mobile Disco.\n \n At around the same time, their record company decided to launch a competition for bedroom acts to remix the Simian track \xE2\x80\x98Never Be Alone\xE2\x80\x99. A then unknown French production duo called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Justice\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Justice</a> entered and didn\xE2\x80\x99t win. This remix was later picked up by DJs like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Erol+Alkan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Erol Alkan</a> and became a huge success.\n \n Simian Mobile Disco then made a few tunes of their own, releasing them on small labels such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Kitsun%C3%A9/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Kitsun&eacute;</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Click+Click+Bang/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Click Click Bang</a>, run by their friends. \n \n As DJs they toured extensively, and were booked to play at events including the Club NME Tour and superclubs like Fabric.\n \n They were then signed up by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Wichita/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Wichita</a> for an album deal and released their debut album \xE2\x80\x98<span title=\"Unknown album\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Attack Decay Sustain Release</span>\xE2\x80\x99 on 4th June 2007. All the tracks on the album began as extended club tracks they used while playing live, but have been edited down to try and keep the album varied and punchy. Guest artists featured on the album include Simon Lord, formerly of Simian, Barry Dobbin from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Clor\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Clor</a> and Go! Team frontwoman Ninja."
