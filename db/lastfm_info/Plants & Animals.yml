     While formed as a mystical folk duo, Plants have blossomed into a full fledged psychedelic band. The recently married musical partners, Joshua and Molly Blanchard, have expanded their sparse sound to include both mushroom laced chamber pop and shimmering instrumental soundscapes. In keeping with a continued spirit of family, the couple have added their nephew, Graeme Enkelis as their new Bass player and cousin, Jesse Stevens on drums and flute. 
     
     The Plants family have a long and close knit relationship with the music community in their native state of Oregon. Molly is classically trained in medieval music and harpsichord as well as collaborating with groups like THE DECEMBERISTS and 31 KNOTS. Joshua has spent ten years crafting songs and hallucinatory electronic pieces with over a dozen projects, most notably in SKIN GRAFT records band, POINT LINE PLANE. Still, its the whole band's love of melodies both strange and familiar that allows them to embrace lush, 60's inspired folk rock or long, mantra-like drones with equal enthusiasm. 
     
     In the beginning of 2006, faced with an overgrown bed of new material, Plants embarked on the lofty goal of recording four full length releases, one to be released each Season. The first was their haunting debut album, &quot;THE MIND IS A BIRD IN THE HAND&quot; released in the Spring on the AUDIO DREGS label. Summer brought TOTEM, a limited edition CDR of exotic acoustic recordings caught on tape in Yurts and empty Military bunkers on the Oregon coastline. This fall saw the third installment of Plants' master plan in an ambitious three song Odyssey called &quot;DOUBLE INFINITY&quot; on the UK label, PARADIGMS. The last of the series, PHOTOSYNTHESIS will be released in May through STRANGE ATTRACTORS AUDIO HOUSE.
