  content: "There are at least 3 Bands named &quot;The Drones&quot;:\n \n 1) The Drones are a group from Australia that rose to prominence during the early 2000's. Artists that have been said to influence the band include: <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Neil Young</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Brains\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bad Brains</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Suicide\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Suicide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+on+Red\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Green on Red</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Birthday+Party\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Birthday Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Van Morrison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nina Simone</a>.\n \n Musically the band does not fit easily into conventional rock music categories. While some of their material is based on conventional rock sounds and song structures, they also venture into the noisy, atonal, blues-based music that Tom Waits brought to a wider audience. The Drones also explore the music of the Australia bush made popular in Australia by Weddings Parties Anything. Like other Australian bands such as The Triffids, The Go-Betweens, Nick Cave and The Dirty Three, The Drones left Australia in 2005 to concentrate on the European market, where a larger market would make it easier to support their unconventional sound. However they eventually returned to Australia to find a ground swell of interest in them - generated by acclaim and publicity both at home and abroad.\n \n The first incarnation of The Drones formed in Perth in 2000. Rui Pereira and Gareth Liddiard had previously played together in the Gutterville Splendour Six, and in early 2001, they relocated to the east coast to accelerate their progress. Initially they met with little success and endured tough conditions including an extended stay in a decrepit Victorian caravan park. They recruited Kitschin and drummer Christian Strybosch, going on to complete their debut album, Here Come The Lies, released on Spooky Records in 2002.\n \n Wait Long By The River...\n \n Sessions for what would become their second album Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By were undertaken during 2004. But once the album was completed, the band had legal problems that stalled the release for over a year. Influential Melbourne indie music figure Bruce Milne's In-Fidelity label eventually released it in early 2005, to enthusiastic reviews from the underground music press. The album was also nominated for Triple J's inaugural J Award prize in 2005 (which was eventually won by Wolfmother), and topped many Australian critics' end-of-year Top 10 lists. Furthermore, Triple J put the album tracks &quot;Shark Fin Blues&quot; and &quot;Baby\xC2\xB2&quot; on medium rotation. During an extensive six month tour encompassing Europe and the US, All Tomorrow's Parties issued Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By outside of Australia towards the end of 2005. Strybosch left around this time to join Dan Kelly and the Alpha Males, and Mike Noga took his place.\n \n In 2006, a record of outtakes from Here Come the Lies and Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By called The Miller's Daughter was released by Bang! Records (a Spanish label which has many other underground Australian bands on its roster). Later that April, up against other notable bands such as Wolfmother, The Go-Betweens, TZU, The Devastations, The Mess Hall, Tex, Don &amp; Charlie and Ben Lee, Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By won the inaugural Australian Music Prize. The Drones continued to tour throughout the year, including a support slot on You Am I's Australian tour in July.\n \n Gala Mill - \n \n The Drones third studio album Gala Mill was recorded in an old mill at Gala Farm in Cranbrook, Tasmania. It was released in September, 2006. The album was also nominated for the 2006 Australian Music Prize. In late 2006, Liddiard announced that Rui Pereira had left the band, to be replaced by Dan Luscombe. \n \n Live In Spaceland - \n \n In November 2006 The Drones, through the American label, Kufala Recordings, released a live album recorded at Spaceland an alternative rock/indie rock nightclub in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.\n \n The Minotaur (EP) and Havilah - \n \n In July, 2008 The Drones released a digital/12&quot; EP featuring new songs &quot;The Minotaur&quot; and &quot;Nail It Down&quot;, the first songs from their next album, Havilah. Havilah was released September 20, 2008 in Australia, with a worldwide release planned for early 2009. The band are undertaking a national tour to promote the album in November, are performing at the Falls Festival in December, 2008 and are scheduled to tour Australia in February, 2009 as part of the St Jerome's Laneway Festival.\n \n __Members__\n \n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gareth+Liddiard\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gareth Liddiard</a> - vocals, guitar\n     * <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Fiona Kitschin</span> - bass\n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Luscombe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dan Luscombe</a> - guitar\n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Noga\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Noga</a> - drums\n \n \n 2) A 1977 era Manchester original Punk Rock act:\n Originally a pub rock called Rockslide who released a single called 'Roller Coaster' which got nowhere.  Sniffing the punk wind of change in'76 however, they emerged as one of the most exciting bands from Manchester's punk scene.  While Slaughter &amp; The Dogs erred on the Glam side and The Buzzcocks delivered pop with a buzzsaw, The Drones, who could obviously play, took the energy of punk to heart and delivered it on vinyl in a series of taut, amphetamine driven toons.  With a mixture of originals like Persecution Complex, Lookalikes and  Corgi Crap and covers such as Search &amp; Destroy &amp; My Generation they blitzed venues like Pips, Rafters and The Electric Circus.\n \n Their first single Temptations Of A White Collar Worker was classic punk containing the excellent Lookalikes. The single sold over 10,000 copies on their own label  OHM's records. \n Signing to Valer records the future looked rosy. The 'Bone Idol / Just Wanna Be Myself' single was the classic and shifted over 20,000 copies. Supporting bands like The Stranglers (even joining them for encores of Go Buddy Go) followed with some good press in the music weeklies like Sounds and features in Fanzines such as Shy Talk and Summer Salt increased their profile.  While recording demos for their Bone Idol single they also  recorded a number of pisstakes of Clash songs which Strummer found amusing on hearing bless him.\n \n The line up was:\n M J Drone (lead vocals &amp; rhythm guitar)\n Gus &quot;Gangrene&quot; Callender (lead guitar and vocals) \n Pete Perfect (drums)\n Steve &quot;Whisper&quot; Cundall (bass). \n \n Recordings:\n \n Temptations of a White Collar Worker (OHMS)\n Further Temptations (Anagram Records) (Album) \n Short Circuit - Live at the Electric Circus [comp]\n Bone Idol (Valer) \n Can't See (fabulous records)(featuring Ellis of the Vibrators on guitar).\n \n 3) A London based contemporary quartet Playing original acoustic music and songs with cello, mandolin, clarinet, percussion, car parts, toys, birdcalls, musical saw, items from the garden shed...\n As seen on : Blue Peter - Channel 4 - The Purcell Room -The Science Museum - The Barbican - Radios 3, 4, and 5.\n Releases:\n Sounds From The Beehive\n Giant Bonsai\n The Drones - Cassette"
