  content: <strong>Liars</strong> is a three-piece band  formed in 2000 consisting of Australian-born Angus Andrew (vocals/guitar), Aaron Hemphill (percussion, guitar, synth), and Julian Gross (drums). Although initially lumped into the New York dance-punk scene of the early 21st century, they have come to be categorized by their dramatic stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and sound texture. <strong>Liars</strong> are one of the many contemporary bands to draw from the late 1970's British post-punk movement. Their first album, 2002's <em>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</em>, bore some resemblance to the work of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+5" class="bbcode_artist">Delta 5</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+of+Four" class="bbcode_artist">Gang of Four</a>, accenting their angular, acerbic punk with modern synths and drum machines. Liar's second album, 2004's <em>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</em>, eschewed their debut's trendy post-punk aesthetic in favor of dissonant atmospherics and electronic soundscapes. That album stratified fans and critics alike, especially chafing with those who took to <em>They Threw Us All</em> for the clear dance/punk leanings of a number of that album's tracks (e.g. &quot;We Live Northeast of Compton&quot;). 2006 saw the release of <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>., which continued the direction they had taken with <em>They Were Wrong</em> but was met with a much more favorable critical reaction. 2007's self-tited LP, <em>Liars</em>, found the band once again shifting styles, this time towards 60's style garage rock and 70's proto-punk, all through the dark, effects-driven prism that Liars began channeling on <em>They Were Wrong</em>. While more straight-forward than their previous 2 LPs, the record contained the same focus on rhythm and experimentation with the deconstruction of traditional sounds. Similar to <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>, <em>Liars</em> was critically praised and found its way on to Best of 2007 lists.
  summary: Liars is a three-piece band  formed in 2000 consisting of Australian-born Angus Andrew (vocals/guitar), Aaron Hemphill (percussion, guitar, synth), and Julian Gross (drums). Although initially lumped into the New York dance-punk scene of the early 21st century, they have come to be categorized by their dramatic stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and sound texture.
