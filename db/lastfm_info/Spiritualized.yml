    Spiritualized is an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3" class="bbcode_artist">Spacemen 3</a> outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.
    
     The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of <a title="The Troggs &ndash; Any Way That You Want Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Troggs/_/Any+Way+That+You+Want+Me" class="bbcode_track">Any Way That You Want Me</a> in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, <a title="Spiritualized - Lazer Guided Melodies" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Lazer+Guided+Melodies" class="bbcode_album">Lazer Guided Melodies</a>), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders" class="bbcode_artist">The Breeders</a> (and later <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lupine+Howl" class="bbcode_artist">Lupine Howl</a>), Refoy formed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Slipstream" class="bbcode_artist">Slipstream</a>(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Ashcroft" class="bbcode_artist">Richard Ashcroft</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Verve" class="bbcode_artist">The Verve</a>. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lupine+Howl" class="bbcode_artist">Lupine Howl</a> following summary dismissal by Pierce.
    
     Sax player Ray 'Moonshake' Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998.
    
     Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Cope" class="bbcode_artist">Julian Cope</a> string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Donor" class="bbcode_artist">Brain Donor</a> and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/solar+fire+trio" class="bbcode_artist">solar fire trio</a>. The remaining line-up finished recording the album <a title="Spiritualized - Songs in A&amp;E" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Songs%2Bin%2BA%2526E" class="bbcode_album">Songs in A&amp;E</a> in Nottingham and London.
    
     The style of Spiritualized is perhaps best described as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">psychedelic rock</a>, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album <a title="My Bloody Valentine - Loveless" href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless" class="bbcode_album">Loveless</a>. The landmark <a title="Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Ladies+and+Gentlemen+We+Are+Floating+in+Space" class="bbcode_album">Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space</a> showed influences from African-American <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">gospel</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/blues" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">blues</a> beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Spector" class="bbcode_artist">Phil Spector</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Wilson</a> began to predominate, which came to a head on <a title="Spiritualized - Let It Come Down" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Let+It+Come+Down" class="bbcode_album">Let It Come Down</a>. <a title="Spiritualized - Amazing Grace" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Amazing+Grace" class="bbcode_album">Amazing Grace</a> favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/soul" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">soul</a> influences heavier than ever.
    
     For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized's then-label, Arista Records.
  summary: Spiritualized is an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3" class="bbcode_artist">Spacemen 3</a> outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.  The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of <a title="The Troggs &ndash; Any Way That You Want Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Troggs/_/Any+Way+That+You+Want+Me" class="bbcode_track">Any Way That You Want Me</a> in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name.
