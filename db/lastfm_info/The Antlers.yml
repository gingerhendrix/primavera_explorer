    <strong>The Antlers</strong> are an indie rock band currently based in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Peter Silberman. Initially, The Antlers was a solo project created by vocalist and guitarist Peter Silberman immediately after he had moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 2007 where he had isolated himself from family and friends. Silberman wrote the first album, &quot;In the Attic of the Universe&quot; by himself and under his own name. Afterwards, he recruited Lerner and Cicci, becoming a collaborative group. The band recorded two EPs: &quot;Cold War&quot; and &quot;New York Hospitals&quot;. Silberman's collection of songs (which was mentioned as an &quot;elegy for his planned disappearance&quot;) would later become a full-length album titled &quot;Hospice&quot; and would feature an epic storyline, telling the story of a man losing a loved one to cancer and having to witness her death first-hand. The album was independently released by the band in March of 2009, selling an apparently overwhelming number of copies, later selling all of their stock and had to produce more. The band later commented that they had &quot;bit off more than they could chew&quot;. The album received critical praise for both its narrative and musicianship and has since been listed on several &quot;Album of the Year&quot; lists. The band later signed with New York-based French Kiss Records. The label released a remastered &quot;Hospice&quot; on August 18, 2009
