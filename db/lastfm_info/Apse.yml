The group made purely instrumental ambient rock until about 2003, when reverberant lead vocals by Bobby became a regular part of the band\xE2\x80\x99s songs.  The lineup expanded over the years and by 2005, Apse was signed to Spain\xE2\x80\x99s Acuarela Discos to record and release its culminating self-titled EP.  "
  content: "Apse was formed in 1999 in Newtown, Connecticut as a three-piece while the members were still in high school. The group made purely instrumental ambient rock until about 2003, when reverberant lead vocals by Bobby became a regular part of the band\xE2\x80\x99s songs.\n \n The lineup expanded over the years and by 2005, Apse was signed to Spain\xE2\x80\x99s Acuarela Discos to record and release its culminating self-titled EP.\n \n Amidst a shifting lineup, the group moved away from the trappings of \xE2\x80\x9Cpost-rock\xE2\x80\x9D territory to write and record its debut full-length album \xE2\x80\x93 the tribal, atmospheric Spirit, released in 2006. Extensive touring (exclusively in Europe) and further lineup changes took place over the course of the next two years, during which time the band signed to ATP Recordings, which gave Spirit a wider re-release in 2008.\n \n A limited edition vinyl LP titled Eras, which signaled the start of a shift in sound for the group, also was released in late 2008, very much under the radar.\n \n Apse is now made up of [sole remaining founder] Bobby, Michael Gundlach, John Mordecai, Jed Armour and Brandon Collins. 2009\xE2\x80\x99s Climb Up sheds much of the gloom, tribal rhythms and esoteric lyrics of Spirit for more eclectic moods across its 12 tracks, coupled with more concrete lyrics exploring the many sides of relationships between people.\n \n Since the early \xE2\x80\x9800s, all Apse\xE2\x80\x99s recorded output has been staunchly self-produced, largely in the members\xE2\x80\x99 own homes with consumer-level equipment. As of summer 2009, ten years since its inception, the band has yet to embark on a proper tour of its home country.\n "
