  content: |-
    Jeremy Jay lives in Angel town, He writes and plays piano and guitar. He says one of his favorite things to do is drive around with the moonroof open and listen to music with his friends. 
     Jeremy has gone on a couple west coast tours and has played with a variety of bands. His performances on the surface seem like a pop singers performance. Dancing, singing and playing guitar.Yet he's still so illusive. Like if you would reach out to grab him you wouldn't touch anything, like all you see is a character from the Dream world. Like Buddy Holly, Peter Pan and John Hughes movies rolled into one. He's pure Storybook.
