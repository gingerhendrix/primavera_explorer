He retook it with the release of Young Prayer (2004) and followed with the critically acclaimed Person Pitch (2007), an album that is said to be the primary inspiration behind Animal Collective\xE2\x80\x99s Merriweather Post Pavillion (2009). \n \n In Animal Collective, Noah\xE2\x80\x99s role was primarily as a percussionist, until his recent transition to samples. He also contributes vocals and plays a variety of other instruments besides percussion/samples.  He adopted the name Panda Bear from an early tape of his material, on which he drew a panda. \n \n He currently lives in Lisbon, Portugal with his wife and daughter."
