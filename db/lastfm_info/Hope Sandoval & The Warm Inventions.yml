  summary: "Hope Sandoval (born 1966) is an American singer-songwriter who was lead singer for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mazzy+Star\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mazzy Star</a> and later Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions.  Hope formed The Warm Inventions and released their first album called &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot;, in 2001. This album sounds, again, little different in terms of theme, voice, and instrumentation than that of her work with Mazzy Star. However, with a larger band behind her, and more time under her creative belt, Hope's voice has matured on these songs.  "

    Hope Sandoval (born 1966) is an American singer-songwriter who was lead singer for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mazzy+Star" class="bbcode_artist">Mazzy Star</a> and later Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions.
     
     Hope formed The Warm Inventions and released their first album called &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot;, in 2001. This album sounds, again, little different in terms of theme, voice, and instrumentation than that of her work with Mazzy Star. However, with a larger band behind her, and more time under her creative belt, Hope's voice has matured on these songs.
     
     Subsequently, The Warm Inventions released three EP's but received very little commercial success, no video on MTV, and very little radio play. Nonetheless, the band's efforts were appreciated by her solid fan base. In 2009, the band released the album &quot;Through The Devil Softly.&quot;
