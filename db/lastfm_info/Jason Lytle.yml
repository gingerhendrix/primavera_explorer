    Jason Lytle fronted Modesto, California based indie rock outfit Grandaddy, which split up in 2006. He was the sole songwriter in the band, and he sang and played most of the instruments on the albums. Live he handled vocals, guitars and keyboards and synths. He has continued as a solo artist after the end of Grandaddy, so far only playing Grandaddy material at a handful of solo shows.
     
     Lytle's first, and long-awaited, solo recording since disbanding his well-loved brainchild Grandaddy, Yours Truly is filled with the signature vintage synths, affecting melodies and fuzzed-out guitars that made Grandaddy a predominant force of the indie rock scene of the late 90s. Yours Truly, the Commuter comes out May 19th.
