  content: "<strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> was a rock music group formed in 1989 in Chicago, Illinois. The band took their name from a common nickname for the basilisk, a type of lizard that can run on water. \n \n While never finding much mainstream success, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> have been called &quot;a leading noise rock band in the American independent underground ... (who) turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-industrial noise, all of which received positive reviews in underground music publications and heavy college-radio play.&quot;\n \n David Yow (vocals) and David Wm. Sims (bass) were both previously in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>, from Austin, Texas, whose sound and approach was similar to Jesus Lizard's. It is possible to see <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> as a progression and semi-continuation of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>'s records as essential listening for <strong>Jesus Lizard</strong> fans.\n \n Their music was a scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and psychotic vocals, often said to be reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Birthday+Party\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Birthday Party</a>, which was an accusation also often made of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>. Denison's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a melody instrument, while the rhythm section's stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Yow\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">David Yow</a>'s frenzied, often incoherent vocals were quite unique, unlike anything past or present. David Sprague suggests that &quot;Yow's disjointed couplets&quot; are reminiscent of a &quot;preacher speaking in tongues.&quot;\n \n Through 1994, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong>'s studio recordings were recorded and engineered by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Steve Albini</a>; he was an avid fan, and his distinctive recording techniques have arguably never been better employed than with <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong>. Albini typically keeps vocals &quot;low in the mix,&quot; or much less prominent than is typical of rock and roll recordings. In the book 'Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Underground 1981-1991', Michael Azerrad writes that &quot;on the Jesus Lizard albums Albini recorded, singer David Yow sounds like a kidnap victim trying to howl through the duct tape over his mouth; the effect is horrific.&quot; (Azerrad, 344)[3]\n \n In 1995, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> signed a contract with Capitol Records, an action which caused a falling out with Albini, famous for his dislike of major record companies. After two records with Capitol, a song on the Clerks soundtrack, and appearances at Lollapalooza, the band split in 1999. In 2000, Touch &amp; Go issued a CD of 7&quot; tracks and rarities called [album]Bang[/album].\n \n After the split some of the members moved on to other bands. \n \n Yow sings in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Qui\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Qui</a>.\n \n Denison plays with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tomahawk\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tomahawk</a>, and with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kimball\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kimball</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Denison+Kimball+Trio\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Denison Kimball Trio</a> (which is actually a duo.)\n "
