His compositions are created with an acute awareness of the listener and their comfort thresholds, exploiting every extreme of pitch and volume. His notorious, building-shaking performances at international festivals including Montreal\xE2\x80\x99s famed MUTEK combine amplified electronics with the furious thrashing of live guitars. Frost himself has been described as \xE2\x80\x9Cone of the most interesting and groundbreaking producers in the world today.\xE2\x80\x9D (Boomkat). His music\xE2\x80\x99s intense physicality has filled gallery spaces and driven contemporary dance productions by Chunky Move, the Icelandic Dance Company, and coreographer Erna \xC3\x93marsdott\xC3\xADr.\n \n The massive scale of Frost\xE2\x80\x99s music often projects a sense of remoteness and isolation and yet he remains in demand as an artistic collaborator, having performed and worked with/for artists as diverse and acclaimed as Bj\xC3\xB6rk, Stars Like Fleas, Tim Hecker, Amiina, Christian Fennesz, J\xC3\xB3hann J\xC3\xB3hannsson, and Bora Yoon, and with celebrated Bedroom Community labelmates Sam Amidon (Appalachian folksinger), Nico Muhly (classical composer), and longtime collaborator Valgeir Sigur\xC3\xB0sson (electronic composer/producer) with whom Frost shares Sigur\xC3\xB0sson\xE2\x80\x99s recording facility Greenhouse Studios in Reykjav\xC3\xADk.\n \n Underlying Frost\xE2\x80\x99s often noisy, defiant aesthetic is a quiet and welcoming humanity, and a subtle sense of emotional drama which has recently bought him to the attention of the film world, where in 2008, utilizing the Icelandic string quartet Amiina, Frost composed the tender but ominous score for the forthcoming True-Crime feature film In Her Skin, starring Sam Neill and Guy Pearce; a cinematic sensibility also pervades his much anticipated forthcoming Lp By The Throat, whose darkly surreal sound-world owes as much to David Lynch as it does to David Lang.\n \n By The Throat will be released by Bedroom Community in September 2009.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.ethermachines.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ethermachines.com</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.bedroomcommunity.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bedroomcommunity.net</a>\n \n :: PRESS QUOTES FOR \xE2\x80\x98THEORY OF MACHINES\xE2\x80\x99\n \n \xE2\x80\x9Cthe compositional complexity of Arvo P\xC3\xA4rt and the sonic nothingness of Wolf Eyes, it is that good!\xE2\x80\x9D - Vice Magazine, USA\n \n \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6simply awesome\xE2\x80\xA6 Frost reminds us that minimalism was never just the polished sheen of Reich and Glass, but also the sweat and grime of Michael Gira\xE2\x80\x99s Swans\xE2\x80\xA6 A deeper, darker minimalism- menacing and claustrophobic\xE2\x80\xA6 This is Arvo P\xC3\xA4rt as arranged by Trent Reznor\xE2\x80\xA6 Magnificent\xE2\x80\x9D -THE WIRE Magazine\n \n \xE2\x80\x9CArresting and exquisite\xE2\x80\xA6 A truly elemental creative force\xE2\x80\xA6 \xE2\x80\x9D -Maryanne Hobbs, BBC Radio One\n \n \xE2\x80\x9CFrost creates a blissful symphony of machines\xE2\x80\xA6 showing that finally we really have moved on. Without a doubt one of the most essential albums you will hear this year \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x98Theory of Machines\xE2\x80\x99 is the future of electronic music\xE2\x80\x9D -Boomkat\n \n \xE2\x80\x9CSonic Youth has softened guitar rock audiences, Lightning Bolt has done the same for many punks, and Fennesz has shown the possibility for melody among noisenik laptoppers\xE2\x80\xA6 if there is a list of noise artists that could permanently change how music listeners view the genre it may be time to add Ben Frost to it. A-\xE2\x80\x9D -Stylus Magazine\n \n \xE2\x80\x9CRecalls the dense, relentlessness of the Swans, A sublime condensation of experience - dynamic, expansive and epic\xE2\x80\xA6 Like the sound of icebergs breaking slowly apart\xE2\x80\x9D -Cyclic Defrost Magazine\n \n :: Collaborations\n \n Frost is the closest collaborator of Icelandic Producer/Engineer Valgeir Sigur\xC3\xB0sson in Greenhouse Studios Reykjavik Iceland.\n \n Frost is commonly mistaken for fellow Australian artist Ben Frost, as both are of similar age and have collaborated on projects together.\n \n Ben Frost is a member of Cicada, a contemporary arts collective that produces large scale audio visual installations and performances.\n \n :: Discography\n \n * 2001 - Frost: Music for Sad Children - Independent (Australia)\n * 2003 - Frost: Steel Wound - Room40 (Australia World)\n * 2004 - School of Emotional Engineering: School of Emotional Engineering - Label (Australia, New Zealand)\n * 2006 - Ben Frost: Theory of Machines - Bedroom Community (Iceland, World)\n * 2009 - By The Throat (Bedroom Community)\n ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n \n 2) Record Producer Ben Frost creates music that spans a huge range of genres from acoustic, live performances to industrial, neo-tech psychadelia. Citing Radiohead amongst his greater influences. Ben is pioneering a new style of fresh and varied alt rock that depends on heavily processed sounds. Having drawn interest from EMI and animal farm productions, national promoters and record labels. He is still searching for a record label who have a decent pair of ears! His forthcoming EP features a handful of slightly more glitzy tracks, some of which were used by the New York, Paris and London fashion shows for the SWAROVSKI collection (the link for which is below). Keep your ears peeled for the latest info on the new band.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.swarovskisparkles.tv/video/fashion/spring-summer-09/london/london-highlights-ss09/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.swarovskisparkles.tv/video/fashion/spring-summer-09/london/london-highlights-ss09/</a>"
