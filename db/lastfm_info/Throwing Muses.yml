    Throwing Muses is a post-punk alternative rock band formed in 1981 in Newport, Rhode Island, United States, that toured and recorded extensively until 1997, when its members began concentrating more on other projects. Originally fronted by two distinctive lead singers, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kristin+Hersh" class="bbcode_artist">Kristin Hersh</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tanya+Donelly" class="bbcode_artist">Tanya Donelly</a>, stepsisters who both wrote the group's songs, Throwing Muses are known for performing music with shifting tempos, creative chord progressions, unorthodox song structures, and surreal lyrics. The group was set apart from other contemporary acts by Hersh's stark, candid writing style; Donelly's pop stylings and vocal harmonies; and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Narcizo" class="bbcode_artist">David Narcizo</a>'s unusual drumming techniques eschewing use of cymbals. Hallucinatory, febrile songs by Hersh occasionally touched on the subject of mental illness, more often drawing portraits of characters from daily life or addressing relationships.
    
     Donelly left the band in 1991 and was a member of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders" class="bbcode_artist">The Breeders</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Belly" class="bbcode_artist">Belly</a>, before starting to perform solo.  She also contributed vocals to the Throwing Muses self-titled album in 2003.  Hersh has also worked solo, and currently fronts the power trio <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/50+Foot+Wave" class="bbcode_artist">50 Foot Wave</a> (which also includes Muses bassist Bernard Georges).  Narcizo works in graphic design and has a musical project <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lakuna" class="bbcode_artist">Lakuna</a>.
