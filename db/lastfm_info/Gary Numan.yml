That seminal track helped usher in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/synthpop\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">synthpop</a> era on both sides of the Atlantic, especially his native England, where he was a genuine pop star and consistent hitmaker during the early \xE2\x80\x9980s. Even after new wave had petered out, Numan\xE2\x80\x99s impact continued to make itself felt; his dark, paranoid vision, theatrically icy alien persona, and clinical, robotic sound were echoed strongly in the work of many <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/goth\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">goth</a> rock and (<em>especially</em>) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">industrial</a> artists to come. For his part, Numan just kept on recording, and by the late \xE2\x80\x9990s, he\xE2\x80\x99d become a hip name to drop; prominent alt-rock bands covered his hits in concert, and a goth-flavored brand of industrial dance christened <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/darkwave\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">darkwave</a> looked to him as its mentor.\n \n Numan was born <strong>Gary Anthony James Webb</strong> on March 8, 1958, in Hammersmith, West London. A shy child, music brought him out of his shell; he began playing guitar in his early teens and played in several short-lived bands. Inspired by the amateurism of the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a> movement, he joined a punk group called &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Lasers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Lasers</a></strong>&quot; in 1976. The following year, he and bassist <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Gardiner\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Paul Gardiner</a></strong> split off to form a new group, dubbed &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tubeway Army</a></strong>&quot;, with drummer <strong><span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Bob Simmonds</span></strong>; they recorded a couple of singles under futuristic pseudonyms (<em>Valerium [or Valerian], Scarlett, and Rael, respectively</em>) that attempted to match their new interest in synthesizers. Scrapping that idea, Webb rechristened himself <strong>Gary Numan</strong> and replaced Simmonds with his uncle <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jess+Lidyard\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jess Lidyard</a></strong>. Thus constituted, &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; cut a set of &quot;<em>punk-meets-Kraftwerk</em>&quot; demos for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Beggars+Banquet/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Beggars Banquet</a> in early 1978, which were released several years later as &quot;<strong><a title=\"Tubeway Army - The Plan\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/The+Plan\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Plan</a></strong>&quot;. That summer, Numan sang a TV commercial jingle for jeans, and toward the end of the year the group\xE2\x80\x99s debut album, &quot;<strong><a title=\"Tubeway Army - Tubeway Army\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/Tubeway+Army\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Tubeway Army</a></strong>&quot;, appeared. Chiefly influenced by &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kraftwerk</a></strong>&quot; and <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">David Bowie</a>\xE2\x80\x99s</strong> Berlin-era collaborations with <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Brian Eno</a></strong>, the album also displayed Numan\xE2\x80\x99s fascination with the electronic, experimental side of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/glam\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">glam</a> (<em>&quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Roxy Music</a></strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ultravox%21\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ultravox!</a></strong>&quot;</em>) and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/krautrock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">krautrock</a> (<em>&quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Can\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Can</a></strong>&quot;</em>), as well as science fiction writer <strong>Philip K. Dick</strong>.\n \n The group\xE2\x80\x99s second album, &quot;<strong><a title=\"Tubeway Army - Replicas\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/Replicas\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Replicas</a></strong>&quot;, was released in early 1979. Its accompanying single, \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Tubeway Army &ndash; Are &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; Electric?\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/_/Are+%E2%80%98Friends%E2%80%99+Electric%3F\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Are &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; Electric?</a></strong>&quot;, was a left-field smash, topping the UK charts and sending &quot;Replicas&quot; to number one on the album listings as well. The record also included \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Tubeway Army &ndash; Down in the Park\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/_/Down+in+the+Park\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Down in the Park</a></strong>&quot;, an oft-covered song that stands as one of Numan\xE2\x80\x99s most gothic outings.\n \n Numan had become a star overnight, despite critical distaste for any music so heavily reliant on synthesizers, and he formed a larger backing band that replaced &quot;Tubeway Army&quot;, keeping Gardiner on bass. &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - The Pleasure Principle\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/The+Pleasure+Principle\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Pleasure Principle</a></strong>&quot; was released in the fall of 1979 and spawned Numan\xE2\x80\x99s international hit \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; Cars\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/Cars\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Cars</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D, which reached the American Top Ten and hit number one in the UK; the album also became Numan\xE2\x80\x99s second straight British number one. He put together a hugely elaborate, futuristic stage show and went on a money-losing tour, and also began to indulge his hobby as an amateur pilot with his newfound wealth.\n \n Numan returned in the fall of 1980 with &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Telekon\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Telekon\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Telekon</a></strong>&quot;, his third straight chart-topping album in Britain, and scored two Top Ten hits with \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; We Are Glass\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/We+Are+Glass\" class=\"bbcode_track\">We Are Glass</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; I Die: You Die\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/I+Die%3A+You+Die\" class=\"bbcode_track\">I Die: You Die</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D; \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; This Wreckage\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/This+Wreckage\" class=\"bbcode_track\">This Wreckage</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D later reached the Top 20.\n \n In 1981, Numan announced his retirement from live performance, playing several farewell concerts just prior to the release of &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Dance\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Dance\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Dance</a></strong>&quot;. While &quot;Dance&quot; and its lead single, \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; She&rsquo;s Got Claws\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/She%E2%80%99s+Got+Claws\" class=\"bbcode_track\">She&rsquo;s Got Claws</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D, were both climbing into the British Top Ten, Numan attempted to fly around the world, but in a bizarre twist was arrested in India on suspicion of spying and smuggling. The charges were dropped, although authorities confiscated his plane. His retirement proved short-lived, but when he returned in 1982 with &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - I, Assassin\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/I%2C+Assassin\" class=\"bbcode_album\">I, Assassin</a></strong>&quot;, some of his popularity had dissipated - perhaps because of the retirement announcement, perhaps because the charts were overflowing with synthpop, much of which was already expanding on Numan\xE2\x80\x99s early innovations (<em>which were starting to sound repetitive</em>). &quot;I, Assassin&quot; was another Top Ten album, and \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; We Take Mystery (to Bed)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/We+Take+Mystery+%28to+Bed%29\" class=\"bbcode_track\">We Take Mystery (to Bed)</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D another major hit, but in general Numan\xE2\x80\x99s singles were starting to slip on the charts; the title track of 1983\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Warriors\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Warriors\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Warriors</a></strong>&quot; became his last British Top Twenty hit (<em>excluding reissues and collaborations</em>).\n \n Numan and Beggars Banquet subsequently parted ways, and Numan formed his own <span title=\"Unknown label\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Numa</span> label, kicking things off with &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Berserker\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Berserker\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Berserker</a></strong>&quot; in late 1984. Sadly, longtime collaborator &quot;Paul Gardiner&quot; died earlier that year from a drug overdose. 1985\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - The Fury\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/The+Fury\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Fury</a></strong>&quot; became the final Numan album to reach the British Top 30. Over the next few years, Numan collaborated occasionally with &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Shakatak\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Shakatak</a>\xE2\x80\x99s</strong>&quot; <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Sharpe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bill Sharpe</a></strong>, releasing four singles and one album from 1985-1989.\n \n Following 1986\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Strange Charm\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Strange+Charm\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Strange Charm</a></strong>&quot;, Numan signed with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/IRS/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">IRS</a>, but the relationship was fraught with discord from the start. IRS forced Numan to change the title of 1988\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Metal Rhythm\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Metal+Rhythm\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Metal Rhythm</a></strong>&quot; to &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - New Anger\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/New+Anger\" class=\"bbcode_album\">New Anger</a></strong>&quot; for his first North American release since 1981 (<em>and also remixed several tracks</em>), refused to release his soundtrack for the film &quot;<strong>The Unborn</strong>&quot;, and would not fund any supporting tours for &quot;New Anger&quot; or 1991\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Outland\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Outland\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Outland</a></strong>&quot;. When his contract expired, Numan returned to Numa for 1992\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Machine + Soul\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Machine%2B%252B%2BSoul\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Machine + Soul</a></strong>&quot;.\n \n 1994 brought the release of the industrial-tinged &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Sacrifice\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Sacrifice\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Sacrifice</a></strong>&quot;, the first glimmering of Numan\xE2\x80\x99s return to critical favor and underground hipness. Over the next few years, bands like &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Hole\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Hole</a></strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Foo+Fighters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Foo Fighters</a></strong>&quot;, and &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Smashing+Pumpkins\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Smashing Pumpkins</a></strong>&quot; covered Numan songs in concert, and <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Marilyn Manson</a></strong> recorded \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Marilyn Manson &ndash; Down in the Park\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson/_/Down+in+the+Park\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Down in the Park</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D for the B-side of the \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Marilyn Manson &ndash; Lunchbox\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson/_/Lunchbox\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Lunchbox</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D single; moreover, &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nine Inch Nails</a></strong>&quot; cited Numan as an important influence. With his fan base refreshed and expectations raised, Numan delved deeper into gothic, metal-tinged industrial dance on 1997\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Exile\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Exile\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Exile</a></strong>&quot;. However, he didn\xE2\x80\x99t truly hit his stride in this newly adopted style until 2000\xE2\x80\x99s &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Pure\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Pure\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pure</a></strong>&quot;, which was acclaimed as his best work in years and expanded his cult following into new territory.\n \n In 2003, Numan enjoyed fleeting chart success once again with the &quot;<strong>Gary Numan vs <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rico\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Rico</a></strong>&quot; single \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan &ndash; Crazier\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/_/Crazier\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Crazier</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D, reaching No.13 in the U.K. chart. Rico, who is an up and coming artist from Glasgow, also worked on the remix album &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Hybrid\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Hybrid\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Hybrid</a></strong>&quot; which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style. In 2004 Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label <span title=\"Unknown label\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Mortal Records</span> and releasing a series of live DVDs as a precursor to his highly anticipated new studio album,  &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Jagged\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Jagged\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Jagged</a></strong>&quot; which was released on 13 March 2006. An album launch gig took place at &quot;<strong>The Forum, London</strong>&quot; on 18 March 2006. Numan announced a UK tour commencing in April 2006 and plans to tour other countries, including the USA, during the year in support of the release. Numan also to launched a &quot;<em>Jagged</em>&quot; website to showcase the new album.\n \n Numan contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of <strong><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ade Fenton</a>\xE2\x80\x99s</strong> debut solo album &quot;<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton - Artificial Perfect\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/Artificial+Perfect\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Artificial Perfect</a></strong>&quot; on his new industrial/electronic label <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Submission/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Submission</a>, including songs \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton &ndash; The Leather Sea\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/_/The+Leather+Sea\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Leather Sea</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton &ndash; Slide Away\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/_/Slide+Away\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Slide Away</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton &ndash; Recall\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/_/Recall\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Recall</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D and the first single to be taken from the album, \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton &ndash; Healing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/_/Healing\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Healing</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D. The second single to be released in the UK was \xE2\x80\x9C<strong><a title=\"Ade Fenton &ndash; The Leather Sea\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ade+Fenton/_/The+Leather+Sea\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Leather Sea</a></strong>\xE2\x80\x9D on July 30, 2007.\n \n In 2008, he released a double CD remix album &quot;<strong><a title=\"Gary Numan - Jagged Edge\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Numan/Jagged+Edge\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Jagged Edge</a></strong>&quot;, based around 2006\xE2\x80\x99s critically acclaimed &quot;Jagged&quot;, co-produced with Ade Fenton. The pair are currently in the studio working on Numan\xE2\x80\x99s 18th studio album &quot;<strong><span title=\"Unknown album\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Splinter</span></strong>&quot;, due for release in 2009.\n \n \n The official website can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.garynuman.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.garynuman.co.uk</a>\n "
