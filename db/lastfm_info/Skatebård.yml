  content: "<strong>Bergen, Norway (2002-present)</strong>\n \n Skateb\xC3\xA5rd (you can call him Skateboard) is another fascinating member of the remarkable Bergen, Norwegian music scene; yes the same magical home of Sondre Lerche, Kings Of Convenience, R\xC3\xB6yksopp and Annie.\n  This offbeat lad began his adventure in music upon the release of his 2002 debut Skateboarding Was A Crime (in 1989) on the legendary Tell\xC3\xA9 electro subsidiary imprint Tellektro. Skateb\xC3\xA5rd conjured a blend of retro-electro, techno to even instrumental\n hip-hop that made a massive mark on the dance community. Getting the better of his ego and seeing the struggles of success faced with his musical comrades in the community, Skateb\xC3\xA5rd opted to keep a low profile, yet anything but disappeared.\n He has gone on to release a steady string of treasured releases on Keys Of Life/S\xC3\xA4hk\xC3\xB6 and the cult label Sex Tags Mania. Least we forget as well, his involvement as a member of the Norwegian hip-hop act Side Brok! But now it's 2006 and times have changed for young Skateb\xC3\xA5rd as he moves back to the spotlight in the boldest of ways having opted away from the opportunities of the larger label machine, he has chosen the path of independent freedom by launching his own imprint DIGITALO ENTERPRISES"
