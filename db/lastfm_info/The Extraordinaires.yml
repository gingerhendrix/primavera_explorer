  content: An indie rock group from Pennsylvania and Charlottesville, Virginia. They've released three CDs, yet the first (&quot;Ikua&quot;) is out of circulation for the time being. The second CD (&quot;Ribbons of War&quot;) is a brilliant themed CD telling the operatic love tale of the brooding Captain, the fair Annelies, and their forbidden love.  Their third CD (&quot;Short Stories&quot;) is composed of songs from their first album, as well as several previously unreleased songs from Ribbons of War.
