  content: "Plants and Animals are a Canadian indie-rock band from Montreal, composed of guitarist-vocalists Warren Spicer and Nic Basque, and drummer-vocalist Matthew Woodley. They are signed to Secret City Records.  \n \n The first seeds of the band were originally planted on Canada\xE2\x80\x99s salty-aired East Coast in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Young Warren C. Spicer and Matthew \xE2\x80\x98the Woodman\xE2\x80\x99 Woodley had begun playing together in high-school bands. The sea winds eventually carried them through the vast plains of Quebec to Montreal (a journey they would come to know intimately as the years wore on). It was in the now hallowed halls of Concordia University\xE2\x80\x99s music department that they would come upon Nicolas Basque, a strange francophone native that shared their musical inclinations (and a trappeur\xE2\x80\x99s finely-tuned taste in cuisine). It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t until then that the three boys became men, signified their union with a name, and that Plants and Animals emerged from the wildlife.\n \n In 2003 they bat out an instrumental menagerie of song-like folk-beasts, and put some of them to tape in the form of a recording that local label Ships at Night would later release. By 2005 the three young men were taming the sprawling wilderness of their sound and sculpting real songs, as Spicer also lead the way to a (hitherto unheard of) vocal domination of their material\xE2\x80\x94as if he had been possessed by the ghost of some recently departed soul singer. During this time Spicer and Woodley would occasionally stop by to care for some of the neighbours\xE2\x80\x94Timber, Socalled, and Katie Moore\xE2\x80\x94and play. All the while, the Halifax-born were jamming and pruning with Basque, harnessing the band and its songs like a wild horse. Some called it post-classic-rock. Some called it folk-prog. Those who knew better didn\xE2\x80\x99t say anything at all.\n \n In about the summer of 2005 they carried a 24-track Studer \xE2\x80\x9Cbull\xE2\x80\x9D up the stairs of Spicer\xE2\x80\x99s apartment and split their time between their new makeshift studio there (aka Le Carillon Tropical), and the Treatment Room. By fall 2006 the foundations of what would later become Parc Avenue were layed, the band was playing shows (and singing), and a relationship with Montreal label Secret City Records was formed. By summer 2007 the once-monster was complete, temporarily tamed, housed, and ready to be unleashed.\n \n While the band awaited the release of Parc Avenue, they kept busy touring in the US, Canada, and Iceland, working on their album art and recording with/avec EP that was released in Canada in October 2007.
