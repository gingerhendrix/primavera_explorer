    Shellac (sometimes referred to as '<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Shellac+Of+North+America" class="bbcode_artist">Shellac Of North America</a>') is an <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/america" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">america</a>n rock music group formed in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/illinois" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">illinois</a>, in 1992 by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini" class="bbcode_artist">Steve Albini</a> (guitar and vocals), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Weston" class="bbcode_artist">Bob Weston</a> (bass guitar vocals) and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Todd+Trainer" class="bbcode_artist">Todd Trainer</a> (drums). They have been classified as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/noise%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">noise rock</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">math rock</a>. Albini has claimed they refer to themselves as 'Shellac of North America', &quot;when we're being pretentious.&quot;
    
     They have a distinctive, minimalist sound based on unusual and urgent time signatures, repetitive heavy rhythms, an angular guitar sound, and Albini's surreal, bitingly sarcastic lyrics. Songs typically do not have traditional verse/chorus/verse structure and the arrangements are sparse, to the point where some describe them as &quot;amelodic&quot;. Shellac's signature sound is often associated with their enthusiasm for vintage Travis Bean guitars, a rare brand of aluminium-based instruments. Albini is also known to use copper plectrums and unique guitar straps that fit around the waist rather than over the shoulder. The band prefers the intimacy of smaller clubs, and live appearances are sporadic.
    
     Both Weston and Albini are renowned recording engineers, and use their preferred methods with Shellac: Albini prefers a very clean, analogue recording sound with little or no overdubbing, and he is meticulous about microphone placings and equipment - this is reflected in Shellac's no nonsense approach to their own music, both in the studio and live.
    
     Shellac are also renowned for their unconventional modus operandi. Touring is often an excuse for the band to take time away from their day jobs (Albini and Weston are both recording engineers; Trainer works at a commercial photographer's studio in Minneapolis) instead of being used to promote a recent record or even for financial gain. Indeed, Shellac do not have a &quot;fixed fee&quot; for performances like most bands, instead preferring to take the door charge minus expenses such as promotion, running costs and venue fees. They have also been known to ask venues to remove ticket charges they regard as unnecessary, which have become common in Europe and America.
    
     An early claim from the band was that all of their songs were about two of Albini's favourite subjects: Baseball and Canada. In actuality, Albini and Weston's songs can refer to a broad range of topics, from the highly emotional to examinations of everyday minutiae. However, regardless of the subject, each song is presented in the same deadpan, occasionally violent manner. An example can be found in the concluding tracks from the band's album <a title="Shellac - 1000 Hurts" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/1000+Hurts" class="bbcode_album">1000 Hurts</a>. Although both songs have a title referring to a mundane house-hold object, these items are in actuality symbolic of a larger theme. Weston's &quot;<a title="Shellac &ndash; Shoe Song" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Shoe+Song" class="bbcode_track">Shoe Song</a>&quot; deals with the realisation of love and its subsequent loss, whereas Albini's &quot;<a title="Shellac &ndash; Watch Song" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Watch+Song" class="bbcode_track">Watch Song</a>&quot; details irrational anger and aggression. Shoe Song also heavily references post-rock band Slint, who were produced by Albini.
    
     Shellac are known for their mercurial nature, which has produced some interesting records and events. Most notably, they recorded an instrumental album known as <a title="Shellac - The Futurist" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/The+Futurist" class="bbcode_album">The Futurist</a> for a modern dance troupe. Unwilling to grant what the band considered a sub-par recording a wider audience, they pressed approximately 700 vinyl LP copies of the music and gave them away as gifts to friends. The front cover was a list of the recipients, with the relevant name encircled. Shellac also played a Halloween show as the anarchic British punk group The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sex+Pistols" class="bbcode_artist">Sex Pistols</a>, featuring former The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jesus+Lizard" class="bbcode_artist">Jesus Lizard</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid" class="bbcode_artist">Scratch Acid</a> singer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Yow" class="bbcode_artist">David Yow</a> as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Rotten" class="bbcode_artist">Johnny Rotten</a>. Both of the aforementioned can now be found on several file-sharing networks.
    
     In 2002, the band was also responsible for curating the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/england" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">england</a>. Amongst fans of independent rock, these weekends have achieved legendary status and featured performances from some of the world's finest groups. Knowing that most of the audience had come specifically to see Shellac, the band went on first every morning as an incentive for the festival-goers to be up in time to see the other acts.  An album of live tracks from this festival was also released on <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/atp%20records" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">atp records</a>.
    
     In December 2004, Shellac recorded a final BBC Session dedicated their longtime fan <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Peel" class="bbcode_artist">John Peel</a>. Peel had been an ardent supporter of the band and his death earlier in the year came as a great shock to the independent music community. In 2005, Shellac were recorded playing '<a title="Shellac &ndash; Steady As She Goes" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Steady+As+She+Goes" class="bbcode_track">Steady As She Goes</a>' in an abandoned house as part of a film project called Burn To Shine, organised by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi" class="bbcode_artist">Fugazi</a> drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brendan+Canty" class="bbcode_artist">Brendan Canty</a> and film-maker <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Christoph Green</span>. This is the only available recorded video footage of the band playing live.
    
     Excellent Italian Greyhound is the latest Shellac release.
    
     The first half could be a holy affirmation, and maybe short of &quot;Prayer to God&quot; features the band's best opening track. &quot;The End of Radio&quot; is a minimalist three-chord funeral march for (you guessed it) radio, as Albini assumes the character of the last DJ (and man) on earth, screaming dedications to a deserted planet. While the vocals aren't as foaming as they've been during live performances, the more desperate and pathetic tone fits this clever conceit. Albini errantly lets out nervous patter and thanks non-existent sponsors before wailing, &quot;Can you hear me now???&quot; and letting loose with the crackling guitar lines we love Shellac for. &quot;Steady as She Goes&quot; is another live staple finally seeing release, exemplary of the thin, metallic chug they've patented, though it's without the tension or left turns of their earlier work.
    
     The band saves the stretching out for side two. &quot;Lulabelle&quot; is undoubtedly the strangest and most difficult track to get through: Its heavy riffage is interrupted by a long segment of the Sinatra-like crooning of some pretty unsettling lyrics, plus voice overs by Ken Nordine and Strongbad. The juxtaposition is hilarious and disturbing, and while you may never play it more than a few times, it's the most confrontational the band gets on this record, as well as closest in spirit to At Action Park or Albini's former projects. &quot;Boycott&quot; is a quick-and-dirty anti-capitalist rant from Weston, and though the metronome tick of the instrumental &quot;Kittypants&quot; strikes me as filler, the other instrumental, &quot;Paco&quot;, is a vicious highlight with atmosphere that's as sparse and evocative as an Ennio Morricone score. The odd interlude that introduces &quot;Spoke&quot; gives way to straight-up punk rock with unintelligible screaming from both Weston and Albini. I can't help but feel like the joke's on the listener here, but it's hard not to smile at it.
    
    
     The haters and the whiners have asked me to tell you that this Shellac record, their first new effort in seven years, has a long song on it where instrumentation stops outright. During this song, Steve Albini sings a capella, joined in vocal commentary by Ken Nordine and Internet villain Strong Bad. Apparently this is even more shocking than the first, long, repetitive song on Terraform or that song about squirrels on 1000 Hurts . If something like this bothers you, maybe you should be looking for another record.
    
     It's baffling what listeners expect out of this project. History has proven that Shellac is not a primary career outlet for any of its members, who have full-time jobs and are fortunate enough to be able to play music for an attentive audience when their schedules allow. You get a record whenever they find the time to make one, and maybe a year later you get the opportunity to see them live. The wait between albums, sadly, serves as somewhat of a countercultural cul-de-sac for its fans. It makes sense, though; they scratch an itch with specialized, raw, primal strokes, brought about by unique and rarefied instruments that only they possess. Albini's guitar has never sounded so rich and burnished as it does here, every sinuous scrape transmitted with detail and control. Bob Weston and Todd Trainer fill out a rhythm section that understands the beauty in space and restraint. Lyrically this one's as vague as any other Shellac record, but musically they've entered a stage of strong, fulfilled, and aggressive songwriting that eclipses damn near all of their output since the initial singles and debut album. &quot;Steady as She Goes,&quot; &quot;Be Prepared,&quot; and &quot;Paco&quot; alone will satisfy just about every fan looking to get their kicks, and &quot;Genuine Lulabelle&quot; and &quot;The End of Radio&quot; will serve as points to drive everyone else pretty crazy. Plus they finally got around to fitting set closer &quot;Spoke&quot; on record, which completes all required documentation on Shellac's early career. Whether you view this as a closing of the books or the dawn of a new era for the band is up to you, but this is easily Shellac's second best album, and inevitably for a lot of you, it will be the soundtrack to your summer of 2007.
