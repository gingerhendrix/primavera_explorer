          <strong>A Certain Ratio</strong> (aka <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Acr" class="bbcode_artist">Acr</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/A.C.R." class="bbcode_artist">A.C.R.</a>) are a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">post-punk</a>/funk band from Manchester, UK. Formed in the late 1970s, they were one of the bands (along with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+of+Four" class="bbcode_artist">Gang of Four</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pop+Group" class="bbcode_artist">The Pop Group</a>) who forged the new musical hybrid which became  known as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk-funk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk-funk</a>, a style which fused the energy and aggression of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/new-wave" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">new-wave</a> with the rhythms and musicianship of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/funk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">funk</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/soul" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">soul</a>.  The band's members were originally <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Topping" class="bbcode_artist">Simon Topping</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jeremy+Kerr" class="bbcode_artist">Jeremy Kerr</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Moscrop" class="bbcode_artist">Martin Moscrop</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Donald+Johnson" class="bbcode_artist">Donald Johnson</a> and <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Pete Terrell</span>. In live performance, the band often had a flexible line-up, with various members swapping instruments, and also performing ensemble latin percussion music.
           
           In 1979, ACR released their debut single &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio &ndash; All Night Party" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/_/All+Night+Party" class="bbcode_track">All Night Party</a>&quot;/&quot;The Thin Boys&quot; on the late <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/tony%20wilson" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">tony wilson</a>'s and the late <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/rob%20gretton" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">rob gretton</a>'s <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/factory%20records" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">factory records</a>, Manchester's legendary DIY collective/record label.
           ACR's early sound consisted of repetitious, effects-heavy guitar lines over a funky rhythm section with Latin percussion and ethereal electronics, over which lay Simon Topping's dark, moody vocals. Examples of this can be heard on tracks such as '<a title="A Certain Ratio &ndash; Do the Du" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/_/Do+the+Du" class="bbcode_track">Do the Du</a>', '<a title="A Certain Ratio &ndash; The Fox" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/_/The+Fox" class="bbcode_track">The Fox</a>' and '<a title="A Certain Ratio &ndash; Winter Hill" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/_/Winter+Hill" class="bbcode_track">Winter Hill</a>'.
           
           The band were initially criticised as being 'style over substance', as much attention was paid to the band's stage clothing and album artwork, all carefully orchestrated by Factory boss Tony Wilson. But ACR nevertheless gained a large following. They completed visits to the US, where their music was popular particularly in the clubs of New York.
           Early albums include &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - To Each..." href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/To+Each..." class="bbcode_album">To Each...</a>&quot; and the studio/live album &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - The Graveyard and the Ballroom" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/The+Graveyard+and+the+Ballroom" class="bbcode_album">The Graveyard and the Ballroom</a>&quot;. 
           
           During the early 80s, the band's personnel changed as Pete Terrell and Simon Topping left, the latter to study percussion in New York. Jeremy Kerr took over vocal duties, while keyboardist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Connell" class="bbcode_artist">Andy Connell</a> joined. During this time, ACR's music became more jazz/latin influenced on the albums &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - Sextet" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/Sextet" class="bbcode_album">Sextet</a>&quot;, featuring vocalist Martha Tilson (of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Occult+Chemistry" class="bbcode_artist">Occult Chemistry</a>), and &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - I'd Like To See You Again" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/I%27d+Like+To+See+You+Again" class="bbcode_album">I'd Like To See You Again</a>&quot;. The latter album contained fewer actual songs but more instrumental tracks than previously. In 1985, Factory released the 'best of...' album &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - The Old &amp; The New" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/The%2BOld%2B%2526%2BThe%2BNew" class="bbcode_album">The Old &amp; The New</a>&quot; which contained that year's single &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio &ndash; Wild Party" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/_/Wild+Party" class="bbcode_track">Wild Party</a>&quot;, a monstrous piece of funk which demonstrated ACR at their peak. ACR released a cover of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder" class="bbcode_artist">Stevie Wonder</a>'s &quot;Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing&quot; as a 12&quot; single with Donald Johnson on vocals. This was an indication of where the band were heading.
           
           In 1986, ACR released the album, &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - Force" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/Force" class="bbcode_album">Force</a>&quot;. This was a more commercial release than previous albums, containing jazz-tinged pop songs with the occasional vocals of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Corinne+Drewery" class="bbcode_artist">Corinne Drewery</a> (of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister" class="bbcode_artist">Swing Out Sister</a>) and saxophone by <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Anthony Quigley</span> (who had recently joined the band).
           
           ACR left Factory Records for the major label A&amp;M. In 1990, the album &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - Good Together" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/Good+Together" class="bbcode_album">Good Together</a>&quot; was released which contained collaborations with Bernard Sumner (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order" class="bbcode_artist">New Order</a>/<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Electronic" class="bbcode_artist">Electronic</a>) and Shaun Ryder (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Happy+Mondays" class="bbcode_artist">Happy Mondays</a>). This album developed the pop sound of &quot;Force&quot; and merged it with <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/acid%20house" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">acid house</a> electronics. This was shortly followed by &quot;<a title="A Certain Ratio - MCR" href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Certain+Ratio/MCR" class="bbcode_album">MCR</a>&quot;, a mini album of new tracks and remixes from 'Good Together'. 'ACR:MCR' was seen as a return to ACR's roots as it was more <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/dance" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">dance</a> orientated and harder edged. Vocalist, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Denise+Johnson" class="bbcode_artist">Denise Johnson</a> (ubiquitous backing singer who provided vocals for many Manchester bands, including Electronic) joined the band in the studio and on the road around this time.
           
           During the nineties, after leaving A&amp;M, ACR recorded for Rob Gretton's new label, Manchester-based Rob's Records; producing more polished <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/house" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">house</a>-based pop funk.
           
           ACR continue to record and gig, maintaining a loyal following. Their early music has been acknowledged to have influenced bands such as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Ferdinand" class="bbcode_artist">Franz Ferdinand</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/radio4" class="bbcode_artist">radio4</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LCD+Soundsystem" class="bbcode_artist">LCD Soundsystem</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Interpol" class="bbcode_artist">Interpol</a>.
           
           Their back-catalogue has been re-released on Creation Records, Soul Jazz Records and LTM Records.
           
           ----------
           
           Throughout ACR's existence, its members have been involved in many diverse projects, usually connected to the Factory Records roster of bands.
           
           After leaving ACR, Simon Topping contributed vocals and percussion to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Quando+Quango" class="bbcode_artist">Quando Quango</a>'s album <a title="Quando Quango - PigsandBattleships" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Quando+Quango/PigsandBattleships" class="bbcode_album">PigsandBattleships</a> and later formed the latin/techno dance act <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/T-Coy" class="bbcode_artist">T-Coy</a>. Donald Johnson drummed in Electronic's live shows and was involved with his brother Derek's soul band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/52nd+Street" class="bbcode_artist">52nd Street</a>. Martin Moscrop and Anthony Quigley played in the bands <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Swamp+Children" class="bbcode_artist">The Swamp Children</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kalima" class="bbcode_artist">Kalima</a>. Corinne Drewery and Andy Connell went on to form the successful pop band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister" class="bbcode_artist">Swing Out Sister</a>. Martin Moscrop also took the role of musical supervisor on Michael Winterbottom's Factory 'biography' film <em>24 Hour Party People</em>.

Her gentle acoustic style has been described as <em>&quot;campfire gospel&quot;</em>.  If you imagine a continuum from the Carter family to Gillian Welch, ending up near Joanna Newsom, this album is it. Rural rather than country, ancient but modern. Rough Trade Shops Album of the year 2007.\n \n   Alela Diane Menig (b April 20, 1983, Nevada City, California, USA) is an American singer and songwriter, who is associated with the psych folk and New Weird America musical genres.  She grew up singing with her musician parents and performing in the school choir. She taught herself guitar, and began writing songs which blend tense, trance-like arpeggios with warm vocals and meditative lyrics about family and nature. Her first recordings were self-released in 2003 as Forest Parade. Her first solo public appearances were at the invitation of fellow Nevada City native Joanna Newsom. She also did a stint in the Nevada City slow grass band Black Bear before continuing with her solo pursuits.\n \n  The songs for her album, 'The Pirate\xE2\x80\x99s Gospel', were written on a trip to Europe. They were recorded in her father\xE2\x80\x99s studio and were initially self-released in 2004, in paper and lace sleeves with hand lettering. The album was issued in revised form by Holocene Music in October 2006, and received widespread critical acclaim.\n \n  A new song, &quot;Dry Grass and Shadows&quot;, was issued on a compilation of Nevada City artists, and five more new songs were issued on a limited-edition 10&quot; vinyl pressing, Songs Whistled Through White Teeth, released in the UK in October 2006. The Pirate's Gospel was released in the UK on Names Records in April 2007, garnering favorable reviews in The Times and NME.\n \n  Alela Diane has toured in the USA both solo and with Tom Brosseau, and has also opened for the Decemberists, Akron/Family and Vashti Bunyan. She performed in the UK in April and August 2007. According to a relatively recent interview, her second album is to be expected shortly. She now lives in Nevada City, California.\n \n  She toured Europe (UK, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) in March, April and May 2008.\n "

          <strong>Andrew Bird</strong> (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">singer-songwriter</a>, a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/violinist" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">violinist</a> and, since 2004, a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">guitarist</a>. He also is an accomplished whistler.
           
           His early work, which echoed of gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.
           
           Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, <em>Music of Hair</em>, in 1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">folk</a> traditions, as well as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">jazz</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/blues" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">blues</a>.
           
           His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Squirrel+Nut+Zippers" class="bbcode_artist">Squirrel Nut Zippers</a>. He was quickly lumped in with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/swing" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">swing</a> craze that swept the <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/United+States" class="bbcode_place">United States</a> music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.
           
           Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird%27s+Bowl+of+Fire" class="bbcode_artist">Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire</a>, he released the album <em>Thrills</em>. This was followed by <em>Oh! The Grandeur</em> in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">folk</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/pre-war%20jazz" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">pre-war jazz</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/swing" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">swing</a>, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.
           
           In 2001, Bird released <em>The Swimming Hour</em>, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. <em>The Swimming Hour</em> featured a mixture of styles, from the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/zydeco" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">zydeco</a>-influenced &quot;Core and Rind&quot; to more straightforward <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">rock</a> songs. He has often referred to this record as his &quot;jukebox album&quot;.
           
           The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Rudy+Day" class="bbcode_artist">Mr. Rudy Day</a>), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.
           
           Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ani+DiFranco" class="bbcode_artist">Ani DiFranco</a>, <a href="http://www.righteousbabe.com/" rel="nofollow">Righteous Babe Records</a>. The two records, 2003's <em>Weather Systems</em> and 2005's <em>The Mysterious Production of Eggs</em>, continue a progression towards an eclectic <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">indie folk</a> sound that has proven challenging to classify.
           
           Bird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a &quot;loop&quot; of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.
           
           Bird's latest full-lenth album <em>Armchair Apocrypha</em> (<a href="http://fatpossum.com/albums.php" rel="nofollow">Fat Possum</a>) was released on March 20th 2007.
           
           November 2007 saw the <em>Soldier On EP</em> originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, &quot;The Trees Were Mistaken&quot;, a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Oh Sister&quot;.
           
           January 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.

          Ariel Pink (born Ariel Marcus Rosenberg on June 24, 1978) is an <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">avant-garde</a>/<a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/hauntology" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">hauntology</a> musician who is based in Los Angeles. Pink has been recording his music on tape since 1996 but it wasn't until after he passed a CD-R to the New York-based band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective" class="bbcode_artist">Animal Collective</a> that his commercial musical career took off. He attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. Later attending the School of Art at the California Institute of the Arts. 
           
           Married to Alisa Daniels, July 2002 - still married.
           
           He has since caught the attention of various media sources, especially in the Los Angeles area. As most of his albums are self-made, many of them have never been heard by fans. The only albums which have been commercially released come from his &quot;Haunted Graffiti&quot; series and are thus the best known.
           
           Pink produces and plays almost all of his own music, and is noted for creating drum sounds using primarily his mouth, and sometimes his armpits. His home recording technique gives his music a very <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/lo-fi" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">lo-fi</a> sound, to the point where new listeners may mistake the era of his music.
           
           Pink cites R. Stevie Moore--friend, mentor, and &quot;father of home recording&quot;--as one of his major influences. He is sometimes associated with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20weird%20america" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">new weird america</a> movement, and could also be considered an embodiment of 'The New Sincerity'. Pink boasts a cult following and endorsements from more widely known artists such as fellow Paw Tracks artists Animal Collective.
           
           Aside from his music, Pink also makes semi-abstract and surreal grotesque drawings, which can be purchased from his unofficial website, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/la3/zanna/" rel="nofollow">ARIEL PINK haunted house</a>, for a hefty price.

        content: "<strong>Art Brut</strong> are an eccentric, motley bunch who have more in common with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Half+Man+Half+Biscuit\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Half Man Half Biscuit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pulp\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pulp</a> than they do with their oft-compared \xE2\x80\x98influences\xE2\x80\x99 <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Fall</a>. The band formed in 2003 and the current line-up consists of Eddie Argos (vocals), Ian Catskilkin  (guitar), Friederike &quot;Freddy&quot; Feedback (bass), Jasper Future (guitar) and Mikey Breyer (drums).\n \n Vocalist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Argos\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eddie Argos</a> (an <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/ex-goth\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">ex-goth</a> obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jonathan+Richman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jonathan Richman</a> and Vincent Van Gogh) had previously been in a band, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Art+Goblins\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Art Goblins</a>, in his hometown of Bournemouth. Their stage show would see him \xE2\x80\x9Cplaying a vacuum cleaner\xE2\x80\x9D and escaping from a sack. They sounded not unlike cult Glaswegians <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Yummy+Fur\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Yummy Fur</a> and had songs such as I Wanna Be Johnny Dean and Disco.\n \n Another \xE2\x80\x98project\xE2\x80\x99 was <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Welsh+Elephant\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Welsh Elephant</a>, who penned the should-be-classic Fuck The MSP (which contains the catchy refrain \xE2\x80\x9C<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nicky+Wire\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nicky Wire</a> can suck my cock!\xE2\x80\x9D). \n Having moved toLondon, UK and determined to be in another band, Argos found himself at a party in Mornington Crescent and set about hassling everyone there to join him. A webzine-editor and guitarist called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Chinchilla\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chris Chinchilla</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/ska\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">ska</a> fanatic) thought this sounded like a good idea \xE2\x80\x93 after all, it was a good way to impress girls. Argos was more concerned about getting on \xE2\x80\x98Top Of The Pops\xE2\x80\x99. Chinchilla talked his German flatmate Frederica (grunge fan) into playing bass, and thus they got a bass guitar for her off eBay. Argos had a friend from Bournemouth who\xE2\x80\x99d also just moved to London. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ian+Catskilkin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ian Catskilkin</a> (thinks he\xE2\x80\x99s in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Led Zeppelin</a>, but with better hair) used to be in a heavy rock band called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Orco\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Orco</a> and he agreed to join the new band. Another friend then overheard a German man (who NME would later say looks like \xE2\x80\x9Che should be in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Interpol\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Interpol</a>\xE2\x80\x9D) on a bus telling someone how he played drums and worked in Merc, the shop on Carnaby Street selling cut-price mod clothing. Determined to hunt him down, Argos and Chinchilla went to the shop. He wasn\xE2\x80\x99t working that day, so they left him a note. Mike (listens to nothing but Weezer) would then join the band, and that was it \xE2\x80\x93 May 2003, Art Brut was born.\n \n Much like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bloc Party</a>, Art Brut\xE2\x80\x99s first gig was an independently promoted show at the Kentish Town Verge. Chinchilla had booked it before the band was ready, at which there was much complaining by his fellow bandmates. Mike\xE2\x80\x99s drumkit had yet to be imported, so he played sitting down (he usually stands up to play). After a number of other gigs round London they recorded a demo named Brutlegs, containing early versions of Formed A Band, Modern Art and Moving To LA, and made it available on their website. Formed A Band first saw the light of day on the debut Angular Records compilation album. After a journalist came across this recording, he sent an MP3 to the label Rough Trade. Within an hour of getting it, the label\xE2\x80\x99s A&amp;R man was in touch offering to release Formed A Band as a single.\n \n Suddenly the band were all over the music press, picking up fans and haters with ease. Many people expected it to be nothing more than a one-off novelty single. They played a triumphant Swedish festival where a guy interviewed them and got confused, thought they were from Manchester (and had all his questions based around the city), and compared them to The Sultans Of Ping. They were also offered the main tour support for Razorlight but had to turn it down due to lack of funds.\n \n Formed A Band was released as a single at the end of March 2004. A gleeful call to arms of sorts, Argos shouts \xE2\x80\x9Cformed a band! We formed a band! Look at us, we formed a band!\xE2\x80\x9D before going on to proclaim how he\xE2\x80\x99s going to \xE2\x80\x9Cwrite a song as universal as Happy Birthday\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cplay it eight weeks in a row on \xE2\x80\x98Top Of The Pops\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D. It reached No. 52, selling 5,000 copies, and cropped up in many end-of-year polls as the one of the best singles of the year, including \xE2\x80\x98Blender\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x93 the USA\xE2\x80\x99s second biggest music mag after \xE2\x80\x98Rolling Stone\xE2\x80\x99 - who proclaimed them the best unsigned band in the UK.\n \n The rest of 2004 saw them playing numerous gigs from Brighton to Manchester, as well as a first anniversary show at the Tate Modern where they were joined by a couple of a Argos\xE2\x80\x99 heroes \xE2\x80\x93 The Vessel (David Devant and His Spirit Wife) and Les \xE2\x80\x98Fruitbat\xE2\x80\x99 Carter (Carter USM). As a stop-gap between singles, they offered the new, shaky Brutlegs 2004, this time containing versions of Good Weekend (the one that goes \xE2\x80\x9Cgot myself a brand new girlfriend\xE2\x80\xA6 I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen her naked TWICE!\xE2\x80\x9D), Bang Bang Rock And Roll and an acoustic version of Moving To LA. \n \n The frenzied Top Of The Pops (not a Rezillos cover) was recorded with a number of bands guesting on vocals (including Ciccone, The Boyfriends, The Long Blondes, Abdoujaparov, Prozak, Rhesus and Luxembourg) for inclusion on the Angular Records compilation Rip Off Your Labels, while Moving To LA saw yet another recorded appearance, this time in live form from the Bath Moles on the compilation Bring Your Own Poison: The Rhythm Factory Sessions.\n \n In December \xE2\x80\x9904, their second single finally saw the light. A double A-side of Modern Art and My Little Brother (with B-side These Animal Menswe@r), it was released on the Fierce Panda label and reached No. 49 \xE2\x80\x93 scoring the band a bigger hit than before and, perhaps surprisingly, the highest chart position Fierce Panda has ever had. All the sleeves of the 7\xE2\x80\x9D were hand-designed by the band and fans, including one messy session at a Queens Of Noize night at Camden Barfly which ended with the stage (and crowd) being covered in fluorescent pink paint.\n \n The start of 2005 sees them having completed their debut album, pencilled in for release in March, and having picked up even more fans including Graham Coxon, British Sea Power, The Libertines, Hope Of The States and genius boy wizard Daniel Radcliffe. Even the Happy Mondays\xE2\x80\x99 Bez has tried to get onstage at one point with them at the Barfly but was so wasted at the time he didn\xE2\x80\x99t manage it, despite Catskilkin\xE2\x80\x99s attempts at pulling him by his arm. \n \n Sadly, they\xE2\x80\x99ve yet to appear on \xE2\x80\x98Top Of The Pops\xE2\x80\x99. Perhaps \xE2\x80\x98CD:UK\xE2\x80\x99 will be more accommodating. It\xE2\x80\x99s better, anyway.\n \n January 2005\n \n In Late August 2005 Chris Chinchilla decided to leave the band for personal reasons and was replaced by former Art Goblin, Jasper Future,"

        content: "Bloc Party are an English <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">indie rock</a> band. In 2005, the band released their critically acclaimed debut album <a title=\"Bloc Party - Silent Alarm\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/Silent+Alarm\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Silent Alarm</a>. Their second studio album, <a title=\"Bloc Party - A Weekend in the City\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/A+Weekend+in+the+City\" class=\"bbcode_album\">A Weekend in the City</a> was released on February 5, 2007 in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United Kingdom</a> and February 6 in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+States\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United States</a>. A third album, <a title=\"Bloc Party - Intimacy\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/Intimacy\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Intimacy</a>, was released in August 2008 as a download and later as a CD release on October 27. The band consists of Kele Okereke (vocals, guitar), Russell Lissack (guitar), Gordon Moakes (bass, vocals) and Matt Tong (drums).\n \n Formation and rising popularity (2006\xE2\x80\x932008)\n \n Bloc Party have been together since 2002, with names such as Superheroes of BMX, The Angel Range, Diet, and Union, before settling on Bloc Party in September 2003. Band members <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kele+Okereke\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kele Okereke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Russell+Lissack\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Russell Lissack</a> have formed the fulcrum of these various incarnations, and were subsequently joined by bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gordon+Moakes\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gordon Moakes</a> who answered an advert in the NME, and most recently drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Tong\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Matt Tong</a>. Lissack and singer/guitarist Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in Essex, where Lissack had grown up and Okereke attended school. Lissack attended Bancroft's School and Okereke attended Ilford County High School until 16 then Trinity School for sixth form. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at the Reading Festival and soon after formed the band Union.\n \n In 2003 they changed their name from Union to Bloc Party. The name is a play on block party, a name for an informal neighbourhood festival, which might hire a local band as entertainment. The band have said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Qu\xC3\xA9b\xC3\xA9cois; the absence of a 'k' is purely for aesthetics.\n \n However, the band's bassist, Gordon Moakes, said on the group's official internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern &quot;blocs&quot; and the western &quot;parties&quot;, in the political sense. Moakes notes that the name was not driven by politics, but rather it &quot;looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it.&quot;\n \n In November 2003, Bloc Party had their track &quot;The Marshalls Are Dead&quot; featured on a compilation CD called The New Cross released by Angular Recording Corporation. Soon after they released their debut single &quot;She's Hearing Voices&quot; on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics.\n \n The band got their break after Okereke went to a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Ferdinand\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Franz Ferdinand</a> concert in 2003, and was able to thrust a copy of the single into the hands of both Franz lead singer Alex Kapranos and Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show, labeling the track &quot;genius&quot;, and invited them to record a live session for the show.\n \n The buzz generated off the back of the single sparked some A&amp;R interest, leading to another single &quot;Banquet&quot;, this time released by the label Moshi Moshi, and to the eventual signing with indie label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.\n \n Bloc Party's own variation of spiky guitar rock draws on influences such as The Cure, Gang of Four, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Pixies, Joy Division, and XTC, but the band says that some of these bands are just comparisons.\n \n The drumming on Bloc Party songs is often influenced by the London dance and R&amp;B scene whilst the guitar demonstrates typical indie sharpness with alternative panned chords and fast chord picking. To achieve their unique guitar style, BOSS echo effects equipment is implemented and is particularly apparent on the track &quot;Like Eating Glass&quot;.\n \n The musical style of A Weekend in the City is more varied, however, drawing influence particularly from more expansive sounding bands, including Radiohead.\n \n \n Silent Alarm (2004\xE2\x80\x932006)\n \n Their debut album Silent Alarm, released in February 2005, was met with critical acclaim and broke sales records, being voted by NME critics as the 2005 album of the year and reaching #3 on UK album charts (selling platinum in the UK). The second single from the album &quot;So Here We Are&quot; made the top 5 on UK charts. Further singles &quot;Banquet&quot; (which reached #13 in NME's &quot;Top 50 singles of 2005&quot;), &quot;Helicopter&quot; (which featured on the FIFA 06, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, Project Gotham Racing 3, Burnout Revenge and Guitar Hero III game soundtracks) and &quot;Pioneers&quot; (July 2005), whilst failing to repeat this success, managed to make dents in the UK top 20. The animated video for the single &quot;Pioneers&quot; was number one in the NME video charts for 4 weeks and was made for a tiny budget in four weeks by the Shoreditch based Mini Vegas design agency.\n \n Even though the band was met with good reviews from critics in America, Bloc Party failed to break through to the pop or rock charts in the US.\n \n Bloc Party became one of the most popular new bands of 2005, and the established electronic group <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Chemical Brothers</a> soon collaborated with Okereke for &quot;Believe&quot;, a track on the Brothers' Push the Button album.\n \n An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm was released at the end of August in the UK. This remix album, Silent Alarm Remixed, retained the album's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet and Mogwai.\n \n During July, they recorded two new tracks (titles were given of &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Two More Years&quot;) with Silent Alarm producer Paul Epworth. The latter, &quot;Two More Years&quot; was released on October 3 to coincide with their October 2005 UK tour. The songs were released as an EP titled Two More Years, accompanied with a re-release of Silent Alarm, which included &quot;Two More Years&quot; itself along with former single &quot;Little Thoughts&quot;. The single format of &quot;Two More Years&quot; contained a remix of &quot;Banquet&quot; done by The Streets, for which a video was also recorded.\n \n The band also contributed the track &quot;The Present&quot; to the Help: a Day in the Life compilation, the profits of which benefits the War Child charity.\n \n The single &quot;Banquet&quot; was sampled in 2006 by DJ Green Lantern for a track with Apathy, Tak (of rap duo Styles of Beyond) and Mike Shinoda. The track, entitled &quot;Bloc Party&quot;, appears on Green Lantern's Fort Minor: We Major mixtape.\n \n A Weekend in the City (2006\xE2\x80\x932008)\n \n The band released their second album, called A Weekend in the City on February 5, 2007 in the UK and February 6 in the United States. The album debuted at #12 in the Billboard 200 with 48,000 copies sold. It became available via the UK's iTunes store a day ahead of schedule, on February 4, and reached the #2 spot in the Official UK Chart. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee. The first single, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, was released on January 29. This single had been located on their MySpace since November 22, 2006. The next single, &quot;I Still Remember&quot;, is their first American single. In the build up to the release of the album, Zane Lowe aired a live set from Maida Vale featuring a mix of old songs and new ones on his evening radio show on BBC Radio 1 on January 30, 2007. On February 1, 2007, A Weekend in the City was made available to listen to for free through the band's official MySpace page.\n \n The band's first gig following the release of AWITC was on February 5 at Reading Hexagon. It was broadcasted live on BBC's Music Station 6 Music that night as well.\n \n Bloc Party played in the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 and T in the Park and the Oxegen Festival that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals 2007. \n \n On 27th October, Bloc Party showed &quot;Flux&quot; to the world at their gig during the BBC Electric Proms, and on November 12th, they released the single. It charted well, reaching #8 in the UK charts, and was well received both by critics and fans, despite the new electronic direction.\n \n Intimacy (2008-present)\n \n On 7th July, Bloc Party premiered new track &quot;Mercury&quot; on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show following a countdown timer on Bloc Party's website. The track took a bold new direction, moving away from guitar rock, with an experimental electronic sound. The track charted at #16 in the UK charts when it was released as a single on the 11th of August.\n \n On the 18th of August, in a webcam chat with fans, they announced that their third album, Intimacy, would be released for download on their website on the 21st of August. The album contained \n On the 23rd and 24th of August, Bloc Party played second headliners before The Killers at <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/event/432551\" class=\"bbcode_event\">Reading</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/event/455250\" class=\"bbcode_event\">Leeds Festivals</a>, opening their set with &quot;Mercury&quot;, and also playing &quot;One Month Off&quot; from their new album. They also played an entirely unplanned encore of &quot;She's Hearing Voices&quot;. \n \n The album Intimacy was released in physical formats on October 27th, featuring additional tracks, such as current single &quot;Talons&quot;.\n \n Trivia:\n \n * The track &quot;Song For Clay (Disappear Here)&quot; is a reference/tribute song to the book <em>Less Than Zero</em> by Bret Easton Ellis and serves as the point of view of the book's main character, Clay Easton.\n \n * The band's live television d\xC3\xA9but was &quot;Helicopter&quot; on the Later with Jools Holland show. In the US, their live television d\xC3\xA9but was on the Late Show with David Letterman, playing &quot;Banquet&quot;.\n \n * The band was on tour with Panic! at the Disco in November-December, 2006. However, they dropped out early in the tour after drummer Matt Tong was admitted to hospital when his lung collapsed during a show in Atlanta on November 9, 2006. Although he quickly recovered, he was advised to rest and so the band dropped out of the tour.\n \n * Bloc Party's largest headlining show was played at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, California on August 3, 2006 with Mew, Two Gallants and Broken Social Scene opening.\n \n * Lead singer Kele embarrassed himself while playing at the Oxegen festival in Ireland in 2005. He declared to the Irish crowd that he was &quot;glad to be back in the UK&quot;. The comment was met with good humour, and a joking &quot;BOO&quot; from the crowd.\n \n * During their Toronto show on March 25th, 2007, lead singer of Broken Social Scene Kevin Drew came out on stage to sing vocals for the track &quot;So Here We Are&quot;.\n \n * Their debut song &quot;This Modern Love&quot; appeared on the final episode of the first season of the popular sitcom series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.\n \n * The track 'I Still Remember' was featured on three episodes of the hit T.V series &quot;The O.C&quot; and in the movie &quot;Prom Night&quot;.\n \n * The track 'Kreuzberg' featured in the second to last episode of the TV series &quot;The O.C&quot;.\n \n * The track SXRT was featured on the episode &quot;The Other Side of This Life (Part 2)&quot; of Grey's Anatomy.\n   \n * The track 'The Prayer' was featured in the episode, &quot;The Prophet&quot; in the series Kyle XY.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.blocparty.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.blocparty.com</a>"

          The Bug is the main current music project of London-based producer Kevin Martin.  Kevin has been a part of a number of  groups including <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Curse+of+the+Golden+Vampire">Curse of the Golden Vampire</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Techno+Animal">Techno Animal</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/God">God</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Experimental+Audio+Research">Experimental Audio Research</a>. The Bug's music draws influence from dancehall, noise, grime, and hip hop. More subdued influences would include dubstep and the dubtronica and broken techno of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Basic+Channel">Basic Channel</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pole">Pole</a>.
           
           The Bug's first album <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bug/Tapping+The+Conversation">Tapping The Conversation</a> was released in 1997 on the seminal Wordsound label. The album was conceived as an alternative soundtrack to the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola film The Conversation. In this incarnation The Bug consisted of Kevin Martin and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Vadim">DJ Vadim</a>.
           
           From 2001-2004 The Bug collaborated with UK reggae soundsystem veteran The Rootsman on a number of limited edition 7&quot; singles, released on the Razor X label.  The project went by the name of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Razor+X+Productions">Razor X Productions</a>.  These releases were characterised by their harsh, aggressive nature both musically and vocally (vocal artists including Jamaican MCs such as He-Man and Wayne Lonesome).
           
           The Bug's second album, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bug/Pressure">Pressure</a> was released on Rephlex Records in 2003. It included a number of more ambient, dub-flavoured tracks alongside the ragga-tinged onslaughts.
           
           In 2004 the Bug collaborated with Warrior Queen on the track <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bug/Aktion+Pak">Aktion Pak</a>.
           
           The Razor X singles were compiled on the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Razor+X+Productions/Killing+Sound">Killing Sound</a> album (along with newer material) which was released by Rephlex in 2006.
           
           Bug projects have included collaborations with a number of singers and MCs including <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cutty+Ranks">Cutty Ranks</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Warrior+Queen">Warrior Queen</a> and Ras B. In 2005 he collaborated with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Stewart">Mark Stewart</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Levene">Keith Levene</a> and has released records on Rephlex, Tigerbeat6 and Klien Records.
           
           Kevin has started a record label called Lady Bug (for releases featuring female vocalists and MCs).
           
           The Bug has produced some radio sessions, including a clash with Soundmurderer on John Peel and a 2006 Breezeblock session with 10 MCs.
           
           In 2006 The Bug launched a monthly London-based reggae club night entitled BASH, in collaboration with dubstep producer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Loefah">Loefah</a>.
           
           In 2007 The Bug's dubplate with Warrior Queen entitled Poison Dart began to spread throughout dubstep clubs and was picked up for release by Ninja Tune.  Also during this period Skeng was released to wide club acclaim.
           
           In 2008 The Bug released London Zoo on Ninja Tune.

           Crystal Antlers formed in January 2006 in Long Beach, California. Creating their own blend of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">psychedelic</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/soul" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">soul</a>, the band quickly became local favorites among a broad range of rock fans.

          Cultivating a singularly unique voice in the world of songwriting and composition is a difficult prospect for all but the most naturally gifted of artists, and Calgary-based songwriter Chad VanGaalen certainly belongs in that category. Infiniheart, an epic tapestry of crunchy guitars, ethereal textures and expressive hooks, exists as a selection of the hundreds upon hundreds of intricate, visionary pop songs VanGaalen has crafted and self-recorded in his bedroom studio since 2000 with a Tascam 4-track, an Akai hard disc recorder and an assortment of analog gadgets. VanGaalen, a skilled animator and illustrator, began his journey busking Canadian streets and art events with a simple setup of drums and guitar before critical acclaim of his recorded material gave way to subsequent opening slots with Stars and the Pixies. As prolific as he is curious about the nature of sound and the mysteries of the heart, VanGaalen's mystical, highly sympathetic characters thematically explore loss, passion and longing through sonic constructions rich in simplicity and peppered with glitchy beats, plaintive, vulnerable vocals and homemade saxophones and violins whittled by VanGaalen himself. Deeply moving and endlessly surprising, Infiniheart is VanGaalen's first for Sub Pop. 
           
           His second album, Skelliconnection, was released in 2006 on Sub Pop and Flemish.

It was his last album for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Sub Pop</a>, and was a much rockier, electric affair. After signing for the Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian, Damien Jurado reverted to his trademark folk ballad-based style, releasing four more albums: <em><a title=\"Damien Jurado - Where Shall You Take Me?\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Where+Shall+You+Take+Me%3F\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Where Shall You Take Me?</a></em>, (2003), <em><a title=\"Damien Jurado - On My Way to Absence\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/On+My+Way+to+Absence\" class=\"bbcode_album\">On My Way to Absence</a></em>,, (2005) <em><a title=\"Damien Jurado - And Now That I'm In Your Shadow\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/And+Now+That+I%27m+In+Your+Shadow\" class=\"bbcode_album\">And Now That I'm In Your Shadow</a></em>, (2006) and <em><a title=\"Damien Jurado - Caught In The Trees\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Caught+In+The+Trees\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Caught In The Trees</a></em>, (2008).\n \n The other two components of the band are <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Fisher\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric Fisher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jenna+Conrad\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jenna Conrad</a>\n \n Oficial site: <a href=\"http://www.damienjurado.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.damienjurado.com</a>\n Oficial blog: <a href=\"iamcaughtinthetrees.blogspot.com\">iamcaughtinthetrees.blogspot.com</a>\n "

        content: "Deerhunter are an indie rock band which formed in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. They currently consist of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, piano), Lockett Pundt (guitar, organ), Josh Fauver (bass, vocals), Whitney Petty (guitar) and Moses Archuleta (drums, synths).\n \n The group began with the ambition of fusing the lulling hypnotic states induced by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">ambient</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/minimalist\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">minimalist</a> music with the klang and propulsion of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/garage%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">garage rock</a>. The band has weathered chaotic line-up changes, the death of a member, and much discouragement. Their live performances almost always leave audiences polarized, and have been referred to by Karen O of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yeah+Yeah+Yeahs\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> in NME as bordering on &quot;a religious experience.&quot; \n \n <a title=\"Deerhunter - Cryptograms\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhunter/Cryptograms\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Cryptograms</a> was the second full-length offering from Deerhunter, and their first for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Kranky/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Kranky</a>. The album took almost two years to finish and was the product of emotional, physical, and financial strain on the group. The result is an album that finds the band shifting from discordant catharsis, and forming a sonic identity that completely expresses the place from which they have arrived. The album functions in part as a study in duality and the concept of the same experiences seen from two angles, present and past. The most obvious manifestation of this is in the chronological sequencing. The first half of the album was recorded first unsuccessfully in 2005. These recordings were a blur at best, wordless and bordering on psychological atrophy. The sessions failed to provide anything tangible, and were racked with technical and personal problems, including out-of-tune pianos, panic attacks, and a tape machine that seemed to fail to capture the full spectrum of ambience the band was exploring. \n \n The band returned home, having failed, and considered giving up. The idea arose to give it one last shot and exactly one year from the date of the recording of their first self-titled LP at a small studio in rural Georgia, they returned to that same studio and plugged in. The session resulted in the first half of the record which was recorded in one day and completely filled the reel of tape they brought with them. Cryptograms\xE2\x80\x99 first side begins with an introduction leading to the title track, and ends with the tape literally spinning off the end of the reel in the middle of a drone layered with bells and accordion (\xE2\x80\x9CRed Ink\xE2\x80\x9D). The second half of the record, also recorded in one day, in November of 2005, represents the band in an entirely different state. \xE2\x80\x9CSpring Hall Convert\xE2\x80\x9D opens with the line, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6so I woke up\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D and introduces a set of focused psych-pop songs fixating on adolescence, illness, and failing connections.\n \n On May 8, 2007, the group released the <a title=\"Deerhunter - Fluorescent Grey\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhunter/Fluorescent+Grey\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Fluorescent Grey</a> EP, which was recorded in July 2006. This EP also garnered the title of &quot;Best New Music&quot; from Pitchfork Media. In the same month, the band released the Whirlyball 7&quot; single, which was available at only one store in Atlanta, Georgia: Criminal Records. The single also acted as a ticket to a show, which featured the band along with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Carbonas\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Carbonas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Selmanaires\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Selmanaires</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Coathangers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Coathangers</a>. The single was available online for a limited time after the show due to popular demand, but only 200 copies were pressed, with 100 on black vinyl and 100 on clear vinyl.\n \n The quartet's third album, slated to come out in 2008, will be titled <a title=\"Deerhunter - Microcastle\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhunter/Microcastle\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Microcastle</a>. One of the songs from the record, whose title has been confirmed as &quot;Twilight at Carbon Lake&quot;, has been described by Cox as &quot;doo-wop, 50s/early 60s, Everly Brothers&quot;. The album leaked in full on the internet on May 31, 2008. It was released on iTunes on August 5.\n \n The band added guitarist Whitney Petty, a former sailor and high school friend of Cox's, to replace the departing Colin Mee in May 2008.\n \n <a href=\"http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/</a>"

        content: "There are at least 3 Bands named &quot;The Drones&quot;:\n \n 1) The Drones are a group from Australia that rose to prominence during the early 2000's. Artists that have been said to influence the band include: <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Neil Young</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Brains\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bad Brains</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Suicide\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Suicide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+on+Red\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Green on Red</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Birthday+Party\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Birthday Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Van Morrison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nina Simone</a>.\n \n Musically the band does not fit easily into conventional rock music categories. While some of their material is based on conventional rock sounds and song structures, they also venture into the noisy, atonal, blues-based music that Tom Waits brought to a wider audience. The Drones also explore the music of the Australia bush made popular in Australia by Weddings Parties Anything. Like other Australian bands such as The Triffids, The Go-Betweens, Nick Cave and The Dirty Three, The Drones left Australia in 2005 to concentrate on the European market, where a larger market would make it easier to support their unconventional sound. However they eventually returned to Australia to find a ground swell of interest in them - generated by acclaim and publicity both at home and abroad.\n \n The first incarnation of The Drones formed in Perth in 2000. Rui Pereira and Gareth Liddiard had previously played together in the Gutterville Splendour Six, and in early 2001, they relocated to the east coast to accelerate their progress. Initially they met with little success and endured tough conditions including an extended stay in a decrepit Victorian caravan park. They recruited Kitschin and drummer Christian Strybosch, going on to complete their debut album, Here Come The Lies, released on Spooky Records in 2002.\n \n Wait Long By The River...\n \n Sessions for what would become their second album Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By were undertaken during 2004. But once the album was completed, the band had legal problems that stalled the release for over a year. Influential Melbourne indie music figure Bruce Milne's In-Fidelity label eventually released it in early 2005, to enthusiastic reviews from the underground music press. The album was also nominated for Triple J's inaugural J Award prize in 2005 (which was eventually won by Wolfmother), and topped many Australian critics' end-of-year Top 10 lists. Furthermore, Triple J put the album tracks &quot;Shark Fin Blues&quot; and &quot;Baby\xC2\xB2&quot; on medium rotation. During an extensive six month tour encompassing Europe and the US, All Tomorrow's Parties issued Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By outside of Australia towards the end of 2005. Strybosch left around this time to join Dan Kelly and the Alpha Males, and Mike Noga took his place.\n \n In 2006, a record of outtakes from Here Come the Lies and Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By called The Miller's Daughter was released by Bang! Records (a Spanish label which has many other underground Australian bands on its roster). Later that April, up against other notable bands such as Wolfmother, The Go-Betweens, TZU, The Devastations, The Mess Hall, Tex, Don &amp; Charlie and Ben Lee, Wait Long By The River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By won the inaugural Australian Music Prize. The Drones continued to tour throughout the year, including a support slot on You Am I's Australian tour in July.\n \n Gala Mill - \n \n The Drones third studio album Gala Mill was recorded in an old mill at Gala Farm in Cranbrook, Tasmania. It was released in September, 2006. The album was also nominated for the 2006 Australian Music Prize. In late 2006, Liddiard announced that Rui Pereira had left the band, to be replaced by Dan Luscombe. \n \n Live In Spaceland - \n \n In November 2006 The Drones, through the American label, Kufala Recordings, released a live album recorded at Spaceland an alternative rock/indie rock nightclub in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.\n \n The Minotaur (EP) and Havilah - \n \n In July, 2008 The Drones released a digital/12&quot; EP featuring new songs &quot;The Minotaur&quot; and &quot;Nail It Down&quot;, the first songs from their next album, Havilah. Havilah was released September 20, 2008 in Australia, with a worldwide release planned for early 2009. The band are undertaking a national tour to promote the album in November, are performing at the Falls Festival in December, 2008 and are scheduled to tour Australia in February, 2009 as part of the St Jerome's Laneway Festival.\n \n __Members__\n \n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gareth+Liddiard\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gareth Liddiard</a> - vocals, guitar\n     * <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Fiona Kitschin</span> - bass\n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Luscombe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dan Luscombe</a> - guitar\n     * <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Noga\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Noga</a> - drums\n \n \n 2) A 1977 era Manchester original Punk Rock act:\n Originally a pub rock called Rockslide who released a single called 'Roller Coaster' which got nowhere.  Sniffing the punk wind of change in'76 however, they emerged as one of the most exciting bands from Manchester's punk scene.  While Slaughter &amp; The Dogs erred on the Glam side and The Buzzcocks delivered pop with a buzzsaw, The Drones, who could obviously play, took the energy of punk to heart and delivered it on vinyl in a series of taut, amphetamine driven toons.  With a mixture of originals like Persecution Complex, Lookalikes and  Corgi Crap and covers such as Search &amp; Destroy &amp; My Generation they blitzed venues like Pips, Rafters and The Electric Circus.\n \n Their first single Temptations Of A White Collar Worker was classic punk containing the excellent Lookalikes. The single sold over 10,000 copies on their own label  OHM's records. \n Signing to Valer records the future looked rosy. The 'Bone Idol / Just Wanna Be Myself' single was the classic and shifted over 20,000 copies. Supporting bands like The Stranglers (even joining them for encores of Go Buddy Go) followed with some good press in the music weeklies like Sounds and features in Fanzines such as Shy Talk and Summer Salt increased their profile.  While recording demos for their Bone Idol single they also  recorded a number of pisstakes of Clash songs which Strummer found amusing on hearing bless him.\n \n The line up was:\n M J Drone (lead vocals &amp; rhythm guitar)\n Gus &quot;Gangrene&quot; Callender (lead guitar and vocals) \n Pete Perfect (drums)\n Steve &quot;Whisper&quot; Cundall (bass). \n \n Recordings:\n \n Temptations of a White Collar Worker (OHMS)\n Further Temptations (Anagram Records) (Album) \n Short Circuit - Live at the Electric Circus [comp]\n Bone Idol (Valer) \n Can't See (fabulous records)(featuring Ellis of the Vibrators on guitar).\n \n 3) A London based contemporary quartet Playing original acoustic music and songs with cello, mandolin, clarinet, percussion, car parts, toys, birdcalls, musical saw, items from the garden shed...\n As seen on : Blue Peter - Channel 4 - The Purcell Room -The Science Museum - The Barbican - Radios 3, 4, and 5.\n Releases:\n Sounds From The Beehive\n Giant Bonsai\n The Drones - Cassette"

        content: |-
          Fucked Up is an experimental hardcore group from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
           
           The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Guitar), Concentration Camp (Vocals), Mustard Gas (Bass Guitar) and Chris Colohan (of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Left+for+Dead" class="bbcode_artist">Left for Dead</a>/<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Swarm" class="bbcode_artist">The Swarm</a>/<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cursed" class="bbcode_artist">Cursed</a>). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp moved to guitar and vocal duties were taken over by Pink Eyes (also known as Mr. Damian). Drums are played by Mr. Jo (also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco) and Young Governor was added as a third guitarist in 2007.
           
           Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7&quot; vinyl 45 rpms. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the band shunned full length LP or CD formats, preferring to output their music two songs at a time. While some record distributors refused to carry the singles, they were generally released to broad appeal, receiving glowing reviews in many punk fanzines. The artwork and feel of the records was a tribute to the [Dangerhouse Records era of punk vinyl.
           
           The band released the &quot;No Pasaran&quot; 7&quot; in May of 2002. The records aesthetic and philosophy was greatly influenced by anarchism and the participation of anarchists in the Spanish Civil War in particular. The cover and insert featured anarchist propaganda posters and portraits of Spanish farmers and peasant soldiers.
           
           The Police 7&quot; was released on March of 2003, quickly followed by what is considered the bands most significant recording, the Baiting the Public 7&quot; in May of 2003. This single was in tribute to the Viennese Actionism, a far left art movement during the 1960s, and the Situationist International. The record featured one song spread over two sides, and illegible liner notes, meant to shock and annoy the buyer.
           
           Two more 7&quot;'s followed in 2004, the Dance of Death single, and the Litany 4-song EP. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004's Epics in Minutes CD.
           
           The band's use of imagery and symbolism took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two obscure and limited 12&quot;s, the Looking for Gold 12&quot;, and the live Let Likes be Cured by Likes 12&quot;. Many felt at this point the band's message became esoteric to the point of confusion, while others felt the turn towards a more convoluted approach was ultimately more rewarding. The Looking for Gold 12&quot; contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in a limited run of 600 copies and immediately became one of the most infamous and sought-after modern hardcore punk releases, selling for over $100 on internet auction sites like ebay. The title track was 17 minutes long, used 19 guitar tracks, had a three minute drum solo and contained 4 minutes of whistling, all unconventional by punk rock song-writing standards.
           
           Following a lengthy and rumoured self-written interview in Maximum Rock and Roll, that discussed some of the band's politics and identity, many people became suspicious of the band's intentions, based on their allusions to mind control, fascism, early 20th centruy occultism, and Nazi mysticism. The release of a split 7&quot; in 2004 with the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Haymaker" class="bbcode_artist">Haymaker</a> did little to allay these concerns as it contained a picture of Hitler addressing a Hitler Youth Rally in 1938. A public clarification followed in late 2004 after the band was attacked onstage at a concert in Toronto.
           
           In the summer of 2004 the band returned to form with the release of the Generation 7&quot; and 12&quot; EPs. The record contained the trademark sound the band had developed with their earlier releases. The record would go onto sell more than 6000 copies in that year and would represent the definitive Fucked Up release of the later period. The live performance of &quot;Generation&quot; had at this point become a focal point of most shows and saw hundreds of people dance and mosh in a mad frenzy of violence and aggression, and would result in many injuries.
           
           After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full time manager/promoter, and released a new UK-only 7&quot;, Triumph of Life, on VICE records. The band is currently signed to Jade Tree Records, on which they released the double album Hidden World in 2006. Hidden World was generally well received in the music community, although many traditional punk fans who once glorified Fucked Up for their &quot;short and fast&quot; older songs couldn't quite grasp Hidden World, which was 74 minutes long. Owen Pallett (commonly known as Final Fantasy) did the strings for the album, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alexisonfire" class="bbcode_artist">Alexisonfire</a>'s vocalist George Pettit made an appearance as a guest vocalist on the final track. The album served as Fucked Up's &quot;major label debut&quot;, receiving positive reviews from Pitchfork Media, SPIN magazine, and NOW magazine. The albums was also picked as &quot;#1 punk album of the year&quot; by the Canadian magazine Exclaim!.
           
           After Hidden World, Fucked Up began their yearly record series based off of the Chinese calendar. They released the Year Of The Dog 12&quot; in late 2006. Fucked Up also appeared on MTV Live Canada in January 2007. Fans in attendance reportedly caused $2000 worth of damages during the recording. After a European tour in the spring and an early summer U.S Tour that took the band to the U.S Southeast for the first time ever, Fucked Up proceeded to play several major music festivals including South by Southwest, Tales Of The Jackalope, Oshesga Fest, and POP Montreal. In July of 2007, the band released the second album in the Chinese calendar series &quot;Year of The Pig&quot;. The 12&quot; is technically a single, featuring the song Year of The Pig and it's b-side Black Hats. Year of The Pig is over 18 minutes long, and is about the treatment of sex workers in Canada.
           
           Currently, the band has made comments about several different projects, including a follow up full length to Hidden World, and a musical based off the song 'David Comes To Life' from the Hidden World album.
        summary: "Fucked Up is an experimental hardcore group from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Guitar), Concentration Camp (Vocals), Mustard Gas (Bass Guitar) and Chris Colohan (of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Left+for+Dead\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Left for Dead</a>/<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Swarm\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Swarm</a>/<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cursed\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Cursed</a>). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp moved to guitar and vocal duties were taken over by Pink Eyes (also known as Mr. Damian). Drums are played by Mr. Jo (also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco) and Young Governor was added as a third guitarist in 2007. "

          Gang Gang Dance is a music group based in New York City, signed to the the <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">Social Registry record label</span>.

           While Gang Gang Dance is generally associated with fellow space cases (Animal Collective, Black Dice), their sound is wholly unique. While their earlier sound was much more chaotic and sprawling, the latest material is a combination of skewed pop music with the unpredictability    of experimental/noise performances. The eerie female vocals are reminiscent at times of an airy Kate Bush, trapped in a deep well with no one to sing to. The band belts out Arabian synth lines mixed with delayed out shimmer guitar, over dark poly-rhythms. Their beat heavy weird tribal-noise appeals to fans of all flavors of marginal and/or left centered pop music. And yes, you can dance to it.

        content: "Dennis Coles (born May 9, 1970 in Staten Island, New York), better known by the stage name Ghostface Killah, is an American rapper. Ghostface first rose to fame as a member of the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wu-Tang Clan</a> hip hop collective. After the group achieved breakthrough success in the early-mid 1990s, each member was free to pursue solo careers; Ghostface's would turn out to be one of the most critically and commercially successful of the group, regardless of, and perhaps due to, his loyalty to his obscure yet highly vivid lyrics and 1970's soul sound. Early in his career, he would wear a mask during performances and photo shoots; it was rumored that this was because Ghostface was wanted by the police and did not publicly remove it until his name was cleared. He is a former follower of The Nation of Gods and Earths and currently a Sunni Muslim. After converting, he changed his name to Abdul Raheem.\n \n \n Career\n \n Ghostface Killah debuted with the rest of the Wu-Tang Clan on &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; and &quot;Tearz&quot; from the Clan's critically acclaimed debut, 1993's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). A roommate of Wu-Tang founder The RZA, Ghostface helped bring together the other seven members, and would function as executive producer on all the Wu-Tang Clan releases.\n \n In 1995, Ghostface would guest star extensively on fellow Clan member Raekwon's debut album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... He also contributed songs to the Sunset Park and Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood soundtracks, which would be included on his first solo LP, Ironman, in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, had a more pronounced soul influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface's future albums would continue this stylistic trait.\n \n Ghostface became well-known for both his up-tempo, seemingly indecipherable stream-of-consciousness rap and, later in his career, for his emotionally charged raps. In 1996 he would discover that he was diabetic, a condition that would severely weaken his health. According to &quot;Trials of Life&quot;, a 2007 song with fellow New York rapper Prodigy (himself a sickle-cell anemic), Ghostface assumed he had been stricken by a sexually transmitted disease until he received the diabetes diagnosis. This assumption was brought on by a rapid weightloss he experienced and that he had &quot;went raw on plenty&quot;.[3]\n \n He would return in 2000 with his follow-up to Ironman, Supreme Clientele, which was critically acclaimed by both hip hop enthusiasts and mainstream critics, and largely credited as reviving the waning Wu-Tang dynasty. &quot;Cherchez LaGhost&quot;, a single off the album, became a minor club hit, and the sentimental &quot;Child's Play&quot; brought numerous comparisons with Slick Rick.\n \n Ghostface wasted little time in recording his next album, the heavily R&amp;B-influenced Bulletproof Wallets, released a year after Supreme Clientele. He had another minor club hit with &quot;Flowers&quot;, which features guest vocals from fellow Wu-Tang members Method Man and Raekwon, although the album would be met with disappointing sales and reviews.\n \n Signing with Def Jam Records, Ghostface (officially but temporarily dropping the &quot;Killah&quot;) released The Pretty Toney Album in April 2004. The album, while containing two RZA productions, featured none of the Clan; instead, it featured collaborations with Missy Elliott, D-Block and Jacki-O. The singles &quot;Tush&quot; and &quot;Run&quot;, the collaborations with Missy and Jadakiss respectively, achieved moderate success in the clubs and charts, and the album was featured on numerous &quot;best of the year&quot; lists, including number nine on Pitchfork Media's.[4] Ghostface also appeared on the track &quot;On My Knees&quot; by UK R&amp;B group The 411, which became a hit in the UK and Australia, and released an album titled 718 (after the Staten Island area code) with a group of his Prot\xC3\xA9g\xC3\xA9s, the Theodore Unit. In November 2005, Ghostface and Theodore Unit's breakout star Trife Da God released a joint project, Put It On The Line.\n \n In 2006, Ghostface teamed up with underground favorite MF DOOM for a still unreleased album entitled Swift &amp; Changeable. MF DOOM also produced several songs for Ghostface's 2006 album Fishscale, which was once again attributed to &quot;Ghostface Killah&quot;. The album debuted strongly, in the #4 position on the US Billboard 200 and at #2 on the R&amp;B charts,[5] the rapper's most auspicious chart showing since the heyday of the Wu-Tang Clan and the release of his solo debut. The album also nearly unanimously received positive reviews. Ghostface embarked on a limited-date tour of US venues in support of the album, performing several of his concerts together with most members of the Wu-Tang Clan.\n \n Also in 2006, Ghostface opened an online-poker room, GFK Poker. He has worked with 4Cast to produce his own action figure.\n \n \n \n Technique\n \n During Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... he focused chiefly on imagery and the use of Wu-Tang's distinctive half-Five Percenter half-slang lyrics.\n \n Ghostface is sometimes considered the least understandable lyricist of the Clan, but also as one of the best. His verses are sometimes stream of consciousness rants. He developed his style, including his storytelling ability, during his solo career and, with the aid of a hand held tape recorder, while making drug deliveries. Ghost often eschews the use of punchlines or similes for metaphors.\n \n Jewelry and fashion\n \n Ghostface has an eccentric collection of unique jewelry that he mentions frequently in verse and interviews. Items heavily referenced are his &quot;eagle bracelet&quot;, a golden eagle statuette worn on his forearm (which has since been melted down), as well as the &quot;Versace Plate&quot; medallion. He also has an affinity for Clark's Wallabee shoes. On the cover of his debut album Ironman, he is pictured with Raekwon and Cappadonna holding several pairs of brightly colored Wallabees. Ghostface actually devised a way of dying Wallabees different, interesting colors, which were the height of fashion at the time. Ghost can be heard discussing this technique on the Cuban Linx record, where he describes dying a pair blue and cream. Often at shows, Ghostface will make a point not to remove his copious layers of clothing, despite the sweltering heat of the stage lights and venue.\n \n \n Aliases\n \n Coles' stage name is derived from the alias of the primary villain from Ninja Checkmate, also known as The Mystery of Chess Boxing (martial arts films had been a major influence on the group).\n \n     * Ghost Face Killer\n \n     His original stage name, which has undergone a number of variations:\n \n         * Ghostface Killer\n         * Ghostface Killah\n         * Ghostface\n \n     * Tony Starks\n \n     Ghostface's Wu-Gambino name, adopted on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995), is derived from the secret identity of the Marvel Comic's character Iron Man, Tony Stark.\n \n     * Ironman\n \n     Ghostface particularly identified with Tony Stark's reliance on the Iron Man armor for sustaining his health, particularly while Ghost was battling diabetes.\n \n     * Pretty Toney\n     * P Tone\n     * Paisley Fontaine\n     * Clyde Smith\n     * Theodore Deini\n     * Talk of New York Tony\n     * Captain America\n     * Starkey Love\n     * Wally Champ\n     * Tony Starks\n     * Ironman\n     * Ghost\n \n     Ghostace has a love for Clark's Wallabees shoes, as well as custom dieing them different colors, evident on the cover of Ironman (1996).\n \n     * Ghost Deini\n     * Chunky Mario Delight And The Rapp-Rappin' Crew\n \n \n Rivalries\n \n [edit] The Notorious B.I.G.\n \n Ghostface and Raekwon &quot;subliminally&quot; dissed The Notorious B.I.G. in several songs, most notably on 1995's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... skit, &quot;Shark Niggaz (Biters)&quot;, wherein the pair make angry references to Bad Boy Records' use of cover art motif from Nas' debut (a portrait of the artist as a child) for B.I.G.'s Ready To Die album. Nas refers to this episode in his song &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive&quot; (from 2002's God's Son), where he confirms the tensions between Raekwon, Ghost and Biggie. On &quot;Ice Water&quot;, also from Cuban Linx, Raekwon raps, &quot;to top it all off, beef with White/ Pullin' bleach out, tryna throw it in my eyesight.&quot; The Notorious B.I.G., who often referred to himself as &quot;The Black Frank White&quot;, would respond on &quot;Kick in the Door&quot; by saying &quot;Fuck that, why try? Throw bleach in your eye.&quot; Despite this conflict, Biggie was a fan of the Wu-Tang Clan, collaborating with Method Man and The RZA on his first and second albums respectively and performing live with Ol' Dirty Bastard on occasion. As Method Man would say in a 2004 XXL interview, Ghostface and Raekwon &quot;don't like anybody&quot;. Despite this, perhaps out of respect for the dead, a bonus track featuring the late B.I.G. (as well as Raekwon) was included on Ghostface's 2006 album Fishscale.\n \n [edit] Mase\n \n After badmouthing Wu-Tang at a concert, Bad Boy recording artist Mase had a run-in with Ghostface and his entourage at New York City club. There was a physical altercation between the two camps, and Mase was left with a broken jaw. This incident became a point of reference for various rappers, including Kanye West on &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, &quot;If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt&quot;, and fellow Wu-Tang Killa Bee Shyheim, who witnessed the incident and referred to it in freestyle as the time &quot;Ghostface retired Mase&quot;. Ghostface touched on it himself on the track Malcolm &quot;Yo I champunch Mase in his face over some bullshit the other night&quot;. In the June 2007 issue of Hip Hop Connection, Wu-Tang affiliate Cilvaringz stated that Ghostface had in fact done jail time for &quot;beating up&quot; Mase.\n \n [edit] 50 Cent\n \n Ghostface also had a feud with 50 Cent in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but unlike other beefs involving Fifty which are typically played out in front of the media, this was not as highly-publicized. On 50 Cent's debut record How To Rob (An Industry Nigga), in which he aims insults at many high-profile rappers and R&amp;B singers, he threatens to rob Ghostface, Raekwon and RZA of their pointed, &quot;funny ass rings&quot;; he would rob Ol Dirty Bastard, &quot;but that'd be a waste of time&quot;. Shortly after the release, Ghostface, Superb, Killa Sin and others were accused of attacking several of 50 Cent's associates at the Hot 97 radio station; another of 50's associates named &quot;Zoo&quot; was robbed by a member of Killarmy. The Wu-affiliated American Cream Team recorded a diss, a song that was widely distributed on the Internet credited to the Wu-Tang Clan. A skit on 2000's Supreme Clientele, &quot;Clyde Smith&quot;, features a low-pitched recording (of Raekwon) naming 50 Cent and derisively making comments on his behavior and methods of attracting media attention through publicized &quot;beef&quot; with other rappers. Around this time, a 50 Cent freestyle dissing the Wu-Tang Clan began circulating; in his ad-libs at the end of the song, he derides them for their frequent use of the term &quot;god&quot; and the poverty of their hometown Staten Island. There have been various rumors of altercations between Ghostface and 50 Cent: one describes Fifty being thrown down a flight of stairs by Ghostface, another claims members of Wu-Tang's entourage robbed Tony Yayo and 50 Cent at gunpoint. However, none have been verified. Since 50 Cent's rise to fame, both he and Ghostface have discussed the supposed beef in interviews, both saying that nothing serious had ever happened.\n \n In July 2007, during a Spin magazine interview with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo alleged that Ghostface did not write his critically acclaimed album Supreme Clientele, but that it was written by long-time Ghostface collaborator Superb. Along with saying Ghostface had a ghostwriter, Yayo also made statements that Wu-Tang Clan's success is over, and that their creativity and lyrical skill doesn't matter anymore since it does not sell to the mainstream. 50 Cent however denied the stronger allegations: &quot;I don't know nothing about any of that. He's the writer. I'm not gonna say he ain't write it.&quot;[7]\n \n In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album responded saying: &quot;He [Tony Yayo] know damn well he [Superb] ain\xE2\x80\x99t write that fuckin\xE2\x80\x99 album. I don\xE2\x80\x99t even wanna get into shit like that, because it just makes me upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways. But at the end of the day, I think Ghost gonna have to really say what he gotta say.&quot;[1]\n \n [edit] D4L\n \n Ghostface ridiculed the &quot;snap&quot; group D4L throughout his 2005 tour, mocking the &quot;snap dance&quot; while his DJ played their hit song &quot;Laffy Taffy&quot;.[citation needed] Ghostface, however, neglected to do this routine when he performed in their hometown of Atlanta.[citation needed] D4L refused to respond in interviews."
        summary: Dennis Coles (born May 9, 1970 in Staten Island, New York), better known by the stage name Ghostface Killah, is an American rapper. Ghostface first rose to fame as a member of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan" class="bbcode_artist">Wu-Tang Clan</a> hip hop collective.

          Having founded seminal Memphis punk outfit <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Reatards" class="bbcode_artist">Reatards</a> at the tender age of sixteen, Jay Reatard (born in 1980) is a seasoned veteran of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/garage-punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">garage-punk</a> scene. In the '90s Reatards turned the Memphis underground rock scene upside down with a legendary live show so over-the-top that they were banned in a number of European countries.
           
           Never content to stick to one genre, one project or one band, Jay also co-led the synth-punk <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Sounds" class="bbcode_artist">Lost Sounds</a> with Alicja Trout, plays drums for The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Final+Solutions" class="bbcode_artist">Final Solutions</a>,does a solo project <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Terror+Visions" class="bbcode_artist">Terror Visions</a>, co-fronts The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/angry+angles" class="bbcode_artist">angry angles</a> and runs his own label Shattered Records. 
           
           In 2006 In The Red announced the release of Blood Visions, Jay's first as a solo artist.

           Jay continues to follow the punk rock freak folk guidelines of the new era.
        summary: "Having founded seminal Memphis punk outfit <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Reatards\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Reatards</a> at the tender age of sixteen, Jay Reatard (born in 1980) is a seasoned veteran of the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/garage-punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">garage-punk</a> scene. In the '90s Reatards turned the Memphis underground rock scene upside down with a legendary live show so over-the-top that they were banned in a number of European countries.  Never content to stick to one genre, one project or one band, Jay also co-led the synth-punk <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Sounds\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Lost Sounds</a> with Alicja Trout, plays drums for The <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Final+Solutions\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Final Solutions</a>,does a solo project <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Terror+Visions\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Terror Visions</a>, co-fronts The <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/angry+angles\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">angry angles</a> and runs his own label Shattered Records.

        content: "Led by the gifted songwriting, impeccable playing, and honeyed harmonies of vocalists/guitarists <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Louris\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gary Louris</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Olson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mark Olson</a>, the Jayhawks' shimmering blend of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/country\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">country</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/folk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">folk</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/bar%20band%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">bar band rock</a> made them one of the most widely acclaimed artists to emerge from the alternative country scene. The group sprung up in 1985 out of the fertile Minneapolis, Minnesota, musical community, where Olson had been playing standup bass in a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rockabilly\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rockabilly</a> band called Stagger Lee until his desire to write and perform his own country-folk material prompted him to begin a solo career. He enlisted <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Perlman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Marc Perlman</a>, the guitarist for a local band called the Neglecters, whom Olson then convinced to take up the bass; after the addition of drummer <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Norm Rogers</span>, the group first played in front of a crowd of less than a dozen people. One of those patrons, however, was <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Louris\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gary Louris</a>, a veteran of the local bands Safety Last and Schnauzer; after the show, he and Olson began talking, and by the end of the evening Louris, a guitarist famed locally for his innovative, pedal steel-like sound, had become a member of the group, eventually named the Jayhawks.\n \n Drawing on influences like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gram+Parsons\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gram Parsons</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Louvin+Brothers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Louvin Brothers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Hardin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tim Hardin</a>, and Nashville Skyline-era <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bob Dylan</a>, the Jayhawks quickly became a local favorite, honing their sound in Twin Cities clubs before releasing their eponymous debut in 1986. Issued in a pressing of just a few thousand copies, the album was well received by those who heard it; a major recording deal did not follow, however, so the band continued to polish their craft live, with more and more of their songs bearing writing credits belonging to both Olson and Louris. In October 1988, after a lineup change which saw the departure of Rogers (who joined <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cows\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Cows</a>) followed by the addition of drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thad+Spencer\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Thad Spencer</a>, Louris was nearly killed in an auto accident, and the Jayhawks went on hiatus. At much the same time, however, executives at the Minneapolis independent label Twin/Tone decided to issue the demos the group had been stockpiling over the past few years, and after some overdubbing and remixing, <a title=\"The Jayhawks - Blue Earth\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/Blue+Earth\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Blue Earth</a> appeared in 1989. Richer in sound and more complex in its themes and concerns, the record's release brought the group considerable attention, and also brought Louris back into the fold. After another drummer switch (Spencer for <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Ken Callahan)</span>, the band hit the road for a national tour.\n \n The Jayhawks were signed to major label American Records after producer George Drakoulias heard The Blue Earth playing in the background during a phone call to Twin/Tone's offices. With Drakoulias in the producer's seat, the band recorded its breakthrough album, <a title=\"The Jayhawks - Hollywood Town Hall\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/Hollywood+Town+Hall\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Hollywood Town Hall</a>, in 1991; a mainstay of critics' annual &quot;best of&quot; lists, the album generated the alternative radio hits &quot;<a title=\"The Jayhawks &ndash; Waiting for the Sun\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/_/Waiting+for+the+Sun\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Waiting for the Sun</a>,&quot; &quot;<a title=\"The Jayhawks &ndash; Take Me With You (When You Go)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/_/Take+Me+With+You+%28When+You+Go%29\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Take Me With You (When You Go)</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a title=\"The Jayhawks &ndash; Settled Down Like Rain\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/_/Settled+Down+Like+Rain\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Settled Down Like Rain</a>.&quot; After a tour which saw the permanent addition of Minneapolis pianist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Karen+Grotberg\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Karen Grotberg</a>, the individual bandmembers guested on albums from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Counting Crows</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Soul Asylum</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maria+McKee\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Maria McKee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Henry\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Joe Henry</a>, and others. Before recording the fourth Jayhawks album, Callahan departed, and was replaced by session drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Heffington\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Don Heffington</a>. The resulting record, 1995's <a title=\"The Jayhawks - Tomorrow the Green Grass\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/Tomorrow+the+Green+Grass\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Tomorrow the Green Grass</a>, is a beautiful collection of songs led off by the elegiac single &quot;<a title=\"The Jayhawks &ndash; Blue\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/_/Blue\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Blue</a>,&quot; the recipient of significant airplay. A tour followed, but after some months on the road, Olson announced he was quitting the band. In 1997, the Jayhawks \xE2\x80\x94 now consisting of Louris, Perlman, Grotberg, and drummer Tim O'Reagan \xE2\x80\x94 released the album Sound of Lies. Grotberg left the band in early 2000, and was replaced by ex-DAG keyboardist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jen+Gunderman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jen Gunderman</a> for the band's sixth album, <a title=\"The Jayhawks - Smile\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/Smile\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Smile</a>. A move to a new label (Lost Highway) in 2002 brought about more changes in the band's ever evolving lineup, leaving Louris, Perlman, and O' Reagan (assisted by newcomer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+McCarthy\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Stephen McCarthy</a> on guitar) to craft 2003's rootsier <a title=\"The Jayhawks - Rainy Day Music\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks/Rainy+Day+Music\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Rainy Day Music</a>.\n \n There was also a group by the same name in the late 50's."

        content: "<strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> was a rock music group formed in 1989 in Chicago, Illinois. The band took their name from a common nickname for the basilisk, a type of lizard that can run on water. \n \n While never finding much mainstream success, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> have been called &quot;a leading noise rock band in the American independent underground ... (who) turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-industrial noise, all of which received positive reviews in underground music publications and heavy college-radio play.&quot;\n \n David Yow (vocals) and David Wm. Sims (bass) were both previously in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>, from Austin, Texas, whose sound and approach was similar to Jesus Lizard's. It is possible to see <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> as a progression and semi-continuation of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>'s records as essential listening for <strong>Jesus Lizard</strong> fans.\n \n Their music was a scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and psychotic vocals, often said to be reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Birthday+Party\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Birthday Party</a>, which was an accusation also often made of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Scratch Acid</a>. Denison's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a melody instrument, while the rhythm section's stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Yow\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">David Yow</a>'s frenzied, often incoherent vocals were quite unique, unlike anything past or present. David Sprague suggests that &quot;Yow's disjointed couplets&quot; are reminiscent of a &quot;preacher speaking in tongues.&quot;\n \n Through 1994, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong>'s studio recordings were recorded and engineered by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Steve Albini</a>; he was an avid fan, and his distinctive recording techniques have arguably never been better employed than with <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong>. Albini typically keeps vocals &quot;low in the mix,&quot; or much less prominent than is typical of rock and roll recordings. In the book 'Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Underground 1981-1991', Michael Azerrad writes that &quot;on the Jesus Lizard albums Albini recorded, singer David Yow sounds like a kidnap victim trying to howl through the duct tape over his mouth; the effect is horrific.&quot; (Azerrad, 344)[3]\n \n In 1995, <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> signed a contract with Capitol Records, an action which caused a falling out with Albini, famous for his dislike of major record companies. After two records with Capitol, a song on the Clerks soundtrack, and appearances at Lollapalooza, the band split in 1999. In 2000, Touch &amp; Go issued a CD of 7&quot; tracks and rarities called [album]Bang[/album].\n \n After the split some of the members moved on to other bands. \n \n Yow sings in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Qui\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Qui</a>.\n \n Denison plays with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tomahawk\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tomahawk</a>, and with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kimball\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kimball</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Denison+Kimball+Trio\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Denison Kimball Trio</a> (which is actually a duo.)\n "

          <strong>Joe Henry</strong> (*1960) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.
           
           Henry was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, but grew up in the Detroit area where he met Melanie Ciccone, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna" class="bbcode_artist">Madonna</a>'s sister, whom he married in 1987. In 1985 he moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he played at small clubs. His debut album Talk of Heaven came out in 1986. He signed to A&amp;M Records and released two albums, Murder of Crows (1989) and Shuffletown (1990)
           
           After Henry and his wife moved to Los Angeles in 1990, he left A&amp;M in 1992 to join the independent label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Mammoth/" class="bbcode_label">Mammoth</a>, located in North Carolina. He released Short Man's Room and Kindness of the World, on which members of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jayhawks" class="bbcode_artist">Jayhawks</a> provided instrumental backing. 
           
           In the mid-1990s Henry decided &quot;to do something decidedly more electric&quot; instead of continuing with country-rock. He turned to producer Patrick McCarthy, in making his next album Trampoline (1996). Trampoline also employed metal guitarist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Page+Hamilton" class="bbcode_artist">Page Hamilton</a>, who demonstrated his own eagerness to stretch by collaborating on the album.
           
           Asked to contribute a song to a benefit album for singer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Vic+Chesnutt" class="bbcode_artist">Vic Chesnutt</a> in 1996, Henry also collaborated with his famous sister-in-law on a cover of Chesnutt's &quot;Guilty by Association&quot; (Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation, The Songs of Vic Chesnutt, 1996).
           
           In 1999 Henry released the experimental album Fuse with trip hop shadings. His eighth album, Scar, followed in 2001. The band on the record consisted mainly of jazz musicians (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Ribot" class="bbcode_artist">Marc Ribot</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Blade" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Blade</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brad+Mehldau" class="bbcode_artist">Brad Mehldau</a> among others) and Jazz saxophonist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman" class="bbcode_artist">Ornette Coleman</a> guesting on the track &quot;Richard Pryor Addresses a Tearful Nation&quot;.
           
           In 2001, Henry sang on the song &quot;Alleluia&quot; from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Julia+Fordham" class="bbcode_artist">Julia Fordham</a>'s album, Concrete Love.
           His self-produced album Tiny Voices appeared on Epitaph's <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Anti/" class="bbcode_label">Anti</a> label in 2003. 
           
           Henry produced <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Thompson" class="bbcode_artist">Teddy Thompson</a>'s 2000 album Teddy Thompson, a critically acclaimed album from the son of British folk legends, Linda Thompson and Richard Thompson. Henry also produced <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke" class="bbcode_artist">Solomon Burke</a>'s 2002 album Don't Give Up On Me, which won Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. 2005 releases produced by Henry include <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ani+DiFranco" class="bbcode_artist">Ani DiFranco</a>'s Knuckle Down, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Aimee+Mann" class="bbcode_artist">Aimee Mann</a>'s 1970s concept album The Forgotten Arm, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bettye+LaVette" class="bbcode_artist">Bettye LaVette</a>'s I've Got My Own Hell to Raise.
           
           He also produced the multi-artist album I Believe to My Soul, which featured <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Allen+Toussaint" class="bbcode_artist">Allen Toussaint</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mavis+Staples" class="bbcode_artist">Mavis Staples</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ann+Peebles" class="bbcode_artist">Ann Peebles</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Irma+Thomas" class="bbcode_artist">Irma Thomas</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Preston" class="bbcode_artist">Billy Preston</a>.
           
           In 2006, Henry teamed with Toussaint, producing his collaborative album with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello" class="bbcode_artist">Elvis Costello</a>, The River in Reverse.
           
           In September of 2006, Joe Henry and his longtime hero <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Loudon+Wainwright+III" class="bbcode_artist">Loudon Wainwright III</a> began composing the music for the Judd Apatow movie Knocked Up. Snippets of instrumentals were used as background score for the film, but the full versions of the songs make up Wainwright's 2007 album Strange Weirdos. Henry produced <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mary+Gauthier" class="bbcode_artist">Mary Gauthier</a>'s 2007 album Between Daylight and Dark.
           
           Joe Henry's current and 10th LP, &quot;Civilians,&quot; was released in 2007 on the Anti label.

        content: "There are two artists with the name <strong>John Maus</strong>:\n \n <strong>(1)</strong> John Maus (born February 23, 1980) is an American composer and political philosophy and theory instructor at the University of Hawaii\xCA\xBBi at M\xC4\x81noa.\n \n Born and raised in the small town of Austin, Minnesota, his first experiments with music were at an early age--in his band the Janitors and by playing guitar for his church.\n \n He is a member of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ariel+Pink%27s+Haunted+Graffiti\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti</a> and has also released some self-produced albums of his own.\n \n <strong>(2)</strong> John Maus is the real name of a member of the sixties band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Walker+Brothers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Walker Brothers</a>. He is more properly known by his professional name, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Walker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">John Walker</a>.\n \n \n When asked to discuss his influences, John Maus (1) replies:\n \n &quot;From the Greeks through the medievalist's music is the science of melody, coming about through ratio not the instinctus naturalis. It is not until Tinctoris - the fifteenth century Flemish theorist and composer - that we think music as something left to the judgment of the ears. It is not until the Renaissance that auctoritas - the authority of the Fathers - is interrupted, allowing innovation and inspiration to become the measure of musical significance, and music, that is, how and from where it comes about, to acquire something like its modern explanation. All this suggests that every one of these discourses on the coming about of music, including our own 'critical' discourse, is inadequate. They are the perpetuation of themselves and the (discursive) regime of which they are a necessary element, not a genuine thinking of the 'coming about' of music. Moreover, the listing of 'musical influences' always oppresses music as cultural capital, as a means of cultural class distinction. \n \n What is significant is precisely what discourse is inadequate to oppress, the hors-texte transformative power of music and its counter-constructivist suggestion that discourse is not the horizon of what there is. That the discourses regarding the coming about of music have transformed through time suggests that there has always been something true of music that none of these discourses could oppress, otherwise one of these discourses would have, once-and-for-all, held-sway. 'Songs' is entirely my fidelity to this 'something true of music,' as it is singularly manifest in the current situation, this is what 'influenced' me in its making, and this is from where it 'comes about.' \n \n To what extent my background played a part in the coming-about 'Songs', as I said, remains an open question. I once saw a television program about a certain kind of plankton that lives two thousand meters beneath the ocean in a pitch black freezing world that has been visited by humans less than outer space has. These plankton used bioluminescence to communicate, or to ward off predators or something. Tiny flashes, like stars, travel through the endless immensity of high pressured timeless shadows, singing their fluorescent songs: now a flash, then darkness. I mention this television program because the dark world it showed was much like the ice fields where I grew up, on the darkest evening of the year, only the vague twinkle of tiny farm houses appeared in the distance.\n \n Though, I think these environmental impressions from my youth manifest themselves much more directly in-terms-of my experimental music interests, not my pop music interests. For instance, when passing through Boone, Iowa on the back of a train car, I went over the Kate Shelley High Bridge, the highest train bridge in America, beneath me as I looked out over the fields I saw an ocean of fire flies: now a flash, then a darkness (now a sound, then a silence). This visual metaphor is much more indicative of Christian Wolff than of The Sensations Fix.&quot;\n \n // Excerpt from <strong>Musique Machine</strong> Interview, <a href=\"http://www.musiquemachine.com/articles/articles_template.php?id=76\" rel=\"nofollow\">&quot;I think We're Alone Now&quot;</a> (2006-05-19)"

          Karl Blau is a musician based in Anacortes, Washington and member of the Knw-Yr-Own/K Records collective. He is very prolific and releases music through a monthly subscription service called Kelp Monthly. He has played in D+, Brothers Blau, Captain Fathom, Your Heart Breaks and has collaborated extensively with Phil Elverum (The Microphones/Mount Eerie). He also tours and records with Laura Veirs.
           
           Blau's music is eclectic and incorporates elements of folk, dub, R&amp;B, bossanova, grunge, hiphop, drone, and worldbeat.
           
           From Karl's own unbiased biography, available on the K Records website:
           
           &quot;I, Karl Blau, am a recording artist from Anacortes, WA. My debut K record &quot;Beneath Waves&quot; should be available in January of 2006. You may have heard my flute, sax, or drums on various K records. I've recorded with Mirah, Wolf Colonel, the Microphones, Little Wings, and I'm one third of the band D+(with Phil Elverum and Bret Lunsford). And more recently I've been touring &amp; recording with the fabulous Laura Veirs.
           
           About 2 years ago I started an &quot;album-a-month club&quot; called KELP! monthly. KELP! is a documentary label tracing my musical path, an avenue for my over-active creative side. People who enjoy the mystery subscribe up to a year and start receiving my records which have included--but will not be limited to--full length albums of mine and artists I'm producing, field recordings, compilations of artists and ambient art records.
           
           I was born into music; my parents met in high school band, Dad was a trumpeter and Mom french horn. I was required to study music starting with 3 years piano, but quickly moved out of the shadow of my older brother's skills and into classical guitar and started getting together with friends and forming bands as early as 12 years old.
           
           With a long stint in the dance band Captain Fathom that lasted through college in Bellingham, I learned the value of all age shows. Captain Fathom played the Skagit Valley's Rexville Grange hall and other halls and spaces, and the shows acted as community gatherings of babies to elders. Through the Fathom years I had found a love for 4-tracking and started uncovering the rich, independent music of Anacortes. Frequenting Anacortes I became acquainted with Bret Lunsford and met and admired a young Phil Elverum. Forming around Bret's incredible lyrics, we brought our band D+ to Olympia for a recording, myself completely unaware of the vast network that is the hub of Olympia(this is 1997 I think). We fell out of our cars and landed in the backyard of the ABC house with Mirah singing backed by Old Time Relijun to a yard full of dining Olyfolk. My mind was blown that a community could be so organized and focused on creating such a memorable occassion. I met Calvin and he seemed to open his doors to anyone whose heart drove them there. My Olympia admiration was further deepened by unearthing the K catalogue and tracing it back to Anacortes.&quot;

          There is more than one artist with this name:
           
           1) Only two weeks into their existence, San Francisco-based psych-electronic trio Lemonade coalesced remarkably fast and performed their first show in 2005. The group- comprised of childhood friends Callan Clendenin (vocals), Alex Pasternak (percussion) and Ben Steidel on bass-did not have grand expectations for the project outside of exploring their shared vision of a place that they have never been: a fantasy landscape that is at once gritty and pristine, tropical and foreboding.
           
           Inspired initially by their interest in drone music, dancehall, and Pasternak's training in Arab and Latin music, they allowed spontaneity, improvisation and intuition to be their fulcrum, allowing them to experience the energy of music-making without having to adapt to the expectations of a rock band. They have since incorporated influences from the spectrum of electronic music, taking cues from the burgeoning UK grime and dubstep scenes, as well as acid house, minimal techno, and the early 'ardkore anthems of Suburban Bass and XL Recordings. While rooted in DIY/hardcore pathos, Lemonade has come to embrace elements of rave culture historically unpopular in the punk community.
           
           Though they've created their own niche in San Francisco's underground-where they are as likely to play an all-night rave, DIY warehouse, or a world music night-they are also a part of an entire community of punk-rooted outsider dance music in the Bay Area, from kindred spirits Tussle to longtime friends C.L.A.W.S., Oro11 of Bersa Discos, and Kid606, progenitor of San Francisco's weird dance aesthetic. Lemonade's sweaty, frenzied live performances have become the talk of the town, always lugging their own soundsystem wherever they go to ensure high fidelity and chest-rattling bass. The result often stuns audiences with their deep, explosive beats, blissed-out samples, and a relentless danceable pulse. They have supported touring acts as diverse as Diplo, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Maga Bo, White Williams, Modeselektor, Crystal Castles, Les Georges Leningrad, and Holy Fuck.
           
           The group's self-titled debut-recorded by Chris Coady (TV On The Radio, Blonde Redhead) for True Panther Sounds-is full of the big beats and heavy psychedelic noises that are central to Lemonade's sound, while touching on elements of North African rai, dub, breakbeat, and samba. The music continues to be defined by the fantasy of where they are going rather than where they have been, a journey to a mysterious, ecstatic place that is the origin of their desire.
           
           2) Lemonade has been composing demoscene music since 1998.
        summary: "There is more than one artist with this name:  1) Only two weeks into their existence, San Francisco-based psych-electronic trio Lemonade coalesced remarkably fast and performed their first show in 2005.

          Lightning Bolt emerged from Providence, Rhode Island, United States in 1995 as a three-piece art school project. Initially there was Brian Chippendale's explosive, non-stop drumming, Brian Gibson's Contortions like bass lines, and Hisham Bharoocha's vocals propelling them in a fury of volatile noise and orgiastic tribalism. The group helped found <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Fort+Thunder/" class="bbcode_label">Fort Thunder</a>, a music and art collective, and recorded <a title="Lightning Bolt - Lightning Bolt" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lightning+Bolt/Lightning+Bolt" class="bbcode_album">Lightning Bolt</a> which was issued through <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Load/" class="bbcode_label">Load</a> in 1999. By 2001's <a title="Lightning Bolt - Ride the Skies" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lightning+Bolt/Ride+the+Skies" class="bbcode_album">Ride the Skies</a>, Bharoocha had departed (he eventually formed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Dice" class="bbcode_artist">Black Dice</a>). This left the vocal duties to Chippendale, who put the microphone into a sock and stuffed it under a mask he wears while performing. Lightning Bolt did a series of tours with bands like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Locust" class="bbcode_artist">The Locust</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arab+on+Radar" class="bbcode_artist">Arab on Radar</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Orchid" class="bbcode_artist">Orchid</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/melt+banana" class="bbcode_artist">melt banana</a> before returning in 2003 with the studio album <a title="Lightning Bolt - Wonderful Rainbow" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lightning+Bolt/Wonderful+Rainbow" class="bbcode_album">Wonderful Rainbow</a>. The album did very well in underground music circles, and set up the release of 2005's <a title="Lightning Bolt - Hypermagic Mountain" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lightning+Bolt/Hypermagic+Mountain" class="bbcode_album">Hypermagic Mountain</a>.
           
           Lightning Bolt is well known for their live performances, in which they turn up the volume as loud as it can possibly go and forgo a traditional stage, preferring to perform amidst the audience.

          The Mae Shi are an experimental punk band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2002.
           
           The band was formed by Tim Byron and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ezra+Buchla" class="bbcode_artist">Ezra Buchla</a>, who had known each other for years, having spent time growing up in the Los Angeles suburb of Claremont together -- Jeff Byron and Buchla were classmates at Claremont High School and close friends. Originally, Tim played guitar, Buchla played a collection of 30-year-old Buchla modules and sang, and varying drummers accompanied them. When Jeff graduated from college, he joined the band on guitar and Tim moved to bass. After a few months of practicing together, the three met Brad Breeck, who was studying at the California Institute of Arts with Buchla and had performed versions of John Zorn's &quot;strategy game piece&quot; Cobra in an ensemble led by Buchla. (The ensemble also featured future Mae Shi drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/corey+fogel" class="bbcode_artist">corey fogel</a>).
           
           The band began performing live in 2003. They were a part of the local scene centered around The Smell. More shows throughout Los Angeles followed, and the band gained a reputation for its high-energy performances. Soon after, they released their first EP, To Hit Armor Class Zero, on the label Byron runs, <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">Join Or Die</span>. They embarked on a tour in the summer of 2003, playing shows on the West coast. In Olympia, WA, they met <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Kill+Rock+Stars/" class="bbcode_label">Kill Rock Stars</a>/5RC founder Slim Moon, with whom they kept in touch after the show.
           
           Through the fall of 2003 and winter of 2004, they worked on their debut LP, recording songs in their living rooms and bedrooms using borrowed gear. They sent a CD-R of the record to Moon in April 2004, and one week later in an Instant Messenger conversation, he offered to release it on Kill Rock Stars' sister label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/5+Rue+Christine/" class="bbcode_label">5 Rue Christine</a>. Terrorbird was released in July 2004, and the band embarked on a 31-day, 32-show tour to promote it, without using a booking agent. The band offered to play any birthday party, wedding, or bar mitzvah for $100. The band played with bands such as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fat+Day" class="bbcode_artist">Fat Day</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rapider+Than+Horsepower" class="bbcode_artist">Rapider Than Horsepower</a>. To promote their first LP to say thanks to their mostly-Los Angeles-based fanbase, they released The Mae Shi 2004 Mixtape. The 70-minute tape collects their favorite parts from their favorite 2000 songs. The Mae Shi performing at the Detour Festival in Los Angeles.
           
           In 2005, they released an EP (titled Heartbeeps for the U.S. version released by 5RC and Go Zbra by Swedish label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Deleted+Art/" class="bbcode_label">Deleted Art</a>), and a split LP with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rapider+Than+Horsepower" class="bbcode_artist">Rapider Than Horsepower</a> called Do Not Ignore the Potential on Narshardaa in Europe (released in January 2006 on Strictly Amateur Films in the U.S). They embarked on a five-week tour of Europe in May 2005 with the band Rapider Then Horsepower. Upon returning to the US in June 2005, they were named &quot;best punk/hardcore band&quot; in the LA Weekly's 2005 Music Awards.
           
           In October 2005, they embarked on another US tour. Corey Fogel, who joined the band in the middle of their European tour as a mid-tour replacement for Brad Breeck when he suffered a family emergency, joined the band full-time as drummer. Breeck now plays guitar, keyboards and drums. To help fund the tour, they released two limited edition CD-Rs, I and II.
           
           Their debut DVD, Lock The Skull, Load The Gun, was released in April 2006 on 5RC. It combined 32 music videos made by friends and fans with an hour-long tour documentary chronicling their Celebration Tour. In July 2006, it was announced that Buchla had left the band approximately two months before. Fogel has also since left the band. Both departing members are now members of Gowns. Breeck has returned to playing the drums. It was announced in September/October 2006 that Jonathan Gray had joined the band as singer/guitarist.
           
           Although the band decided to not play outside of their LA home after their Fall 2005 tour, they participated in a small two week East Coast tour in August 2007 with Yea Big + Kid Static. On the tour, the band offered two limited edition CD-Rs, &quot;III&quot; (which was mostly HLLLYH outtakes) and &quot;IIII&quot;, along with a limited release of HLLLYH on cassette.
           
           On December 2, 2007 the band debuted Bill Gray and Marcus Savino in their live line up to replace bassist Tim Byron and drummer Brad Breeck, who will continue on with the The Mae Shi, but not tour with them. With their new line up, they embarked on a 4 day tour with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Germs" class="bbcode_artist">The Germs</a> in late December 2007, followed by a two week tour in the UK during January/February 2008 promoting their new album. They ambitiously played 18 shows at SXSW(South by South-West) in March 2008. 
           
           Their third release, HLLLYH, was released on the labels <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Moshi+Moshi/" class="bbcode_label">Moshi Moshi</a> (UK) and <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Team+Shi/" class="bbcode_label">Team Shi</a> (America) on February 11, 2008. They are already working on a new EP featuring all six current members of The Mae Shi.
           
           <strong>Current members</strong>
            * Jonathan Gray - vocals, keyboards
            * Jeff Byron - guitar, vocals
            * Tim Byron - bass, vocals
            * Brad Breeck - drums

        content: |-
          In March 2003, while on tour, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Molina" class="bbcode_artist">Jason Molina</a> announced that he would rename his band (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Songs%3A+Ohia" class="bbcode_artist">Songs: Ohia</a>) <strong>Magnolia Electric Co.</strong> This new incarnation would retain many of the original players and the stylistic direction of the album of the same name. Jason Molina would also continue to release solo work, but this time under his own name. The first such release came in January of 2004, as the full length vinyl release <em>Pyramid Electric Co.</em> While <em>Magnolia Electric Co.</em> and <em>Pyramid Electric Co.</em> were originally intended as a double album, the latter seems to be the stylistic polar opposite of the former. Engineered by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Mogis" class="bbcode_artist">Mike Mogis</a>, who also engineered <em>Ghost Tropic</em>, <em>Pyramid</em> finds Jason Molina alone at the microphone with only his voice, a piano or a guitar. Magnolia Electric Co.'s first official release was a live album called <em>Trials and Errors</em>, followed by a studio album titled <em>What Comes After The Blues</em> and an EP, <em>Hard To Love a Man</em>, all three released in 2005.
           
           It is not entirely clear when Songs: Ohia became Magnolia Electric Co. In interviews, Jason Molina has claimed that he considered the tenure of Songs: Ohia over after <em>Didn't It Rain</em>, which would make Magnolia Electric Co. the eponymous debut album of the new band. In fact the name Songs: Ohia appears nowhere on the artwork of the album and only a promotional sticker on the cellophane wrapping connects it with the prior band name. Nevertheless, Secretly Canadian still promotes the album under the Songs: Ohia moniker. On the other hand, the Magnolia Electric Co. live album <em>Trials and Errors</em> was recorded on April 16, 2003 at the Ancienne Belgique club in Brussels, at a time when the band was still touring under the Songs: Ohia name. Pitchfork Media later reported that name change would be made official after the <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Spain" class="bbcode_place">Spain</a> tour in October 2003, although by now it seems the label espouses a name change around July 2003.
           
           On January 13, 2006, Molina told a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago">Chicago</a> newspaper that he had recorded three records which were to be released within a few months. A solo record, titled <em>Let Me Go</em>, was recorded February 2005 in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/indiana">Indiana</a> and features a return to the voice/piano/guitar style that <em>Pyramid Electric Co.</em> was recorded in. A Magnolia Electric Co. album, <em>Nashville Moon</em>, was recorded during July 2005 with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini" class="bbcode_artist">Steve Albini</a> at Electrical Audio in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago">Chicago</a>. Molina stated that there was a heavy atmosphere in the studio, due to the fact that three of Albini's close friends had died in a car crash. The third record to be released is a full length collaboration with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Camper+Van+Beethoven" class="bbcode_artist">Camper Van Beethoven</a> front man <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Lowery" class="bbcode_artist">David Lowery</a>, tentatively named <em>The Black Ram</em>. During the sessions for the album, Molina's mother suffered a stroke, went into a coma and has been on life support since then.
           
           In the article, Molina also commented on his determined work ethic: &quot;Every New Year I throw out songs. I just threw out probably 20 tapes full of demos and I didn't even listen to them... Getting rid of all that old stuff really forces you to write new material.&quot;
           
           Though officially Songs: Ohia no longer records or performs, and projects have been either marketed as Magnolia Electric Co. or Jason Molina's solo work, most fans still use the name Songs: Ohia to refer to all projects collectively.
        summary: "In March 2003, while on tour, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Molina\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jason Molina</a> announced that he would rename his band (<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Songs%3A+Ohia\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Songs: Ohia</a>) Magnolia Electric Co.

        content: Chicago party animals, Mahjongg, originally from Columbia, MO, may be nearing the top of Chicago's 'local band' heap, but if you haven't heard of them yet it's probably because their music has made it quite difficult for locals to nail them down in a 'scene.' Mahjongg's shows are always ragers, which often leads attendees to shove (or drop) the actual musicianship from their memories - a shame since they're onto something pretty damn cool. Their music toes the slightly familiar line between rock and dance music (a la <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mouse+on+Mars" class="bbcode_artist">Mouse on Mars</a>), but also manages to work in the grooves of coastal revivalists like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/%21%21%21" class="bbcode_artist">!!!</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Out+Hud" class="bbcode_artist">Out Hud</a>. Their points of reference may not dig quite as deep, but the overall product is exactly what it seems to aim for - a good time. Mahjongg's full-length debut, <em>RaYDONcoNG 2005</em>, is available on (the now defunct) <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">Cold Crush Records</span>.  Their next full length will be released in 2008 via <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/K+Records/" class="bbcode_label">K Records</a>.

        content: "Michael Mayer was born and brought up in the clean air of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), deep in Germany\xE2\x80\x99s south-west corner. The days and nights of his childhood were filled with music, either liberated from his parents\xE2\x80\x99 collection, absorbed via his bedside radio or tentatively played on the household\xE2\x80\x99s piano. He first heard DJs at youth discos and was smitten, immediately beginning his own record collection - Italian disco, the Pet Shop Boys, extended 12\xE2\x80\x9D mixes of pop tracks and classic funk are its foundations. At the age of 20 Michael moved to Cologne, the warmest part of Germany in both temperature and attitude. With the help of Wolfgang and Reinhardt Voigt - already cherished Cologne artists - he forged a characteristically grounded career, equally mundane and insane. Michael\xE2\x80\x99s time is split between producing tracks, DJing globally and overseeing the distribution of many of Europe\xE2\x80\x99s underground labels. He works at Kompakt, a deceptively named business incorporating a vibrant release schedule, recording studios, distribution centres and a gigantic record store, all in the heart of Cologne. Every Friday Michael eats with best pals and fellow Kompakt artists Tobias Thomas and Aksel Superpitcher, before partying at Total Confusion, their Studio 672 clubnight. \n \n \xE2\x80\x9CFor me it\xE2\x80\x99s the perfect balance. If I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t in a club every weekend and listening to all the records we distribute through the week then I\xE2\x80\x99m sure I\xE2\x80\x99d have a problem and wonder why I\xE2\x80\x99m doing all of this. And it\xE2\x80\x99s the same the other way around: as a DJ travelling around I would be missing my anchor. I need a straight job, an office job to keep me right. To ensure that I don\xE2\x80\x99t lose my head. I like doing normal things during the week and then being wild at weekends. Yin and yang.\xE2\x80\x9D\n \n \xE2\x80\x9CThe only thing I pre-determine is that I play 4/4. The rest happens by accident. I love the deeper side of music, obviously, but I like it raw and kicking. There has to be some pop too and my sets are very pop influenced: I don\xE2\x80\x99t mix tools for hours, there has to be waves like a pop song. I love records that are structured, that have a beginning/middle/end. It\xE2\x80\x99s the same for any clubnight, there has to be that progression. I love to warm up and take my time to get in to it, to take people with me. At the end I love to play songs and some things you can whistle on the way home.\xE2\x80\x9D"
        summary: "Michael Mayer was born and brought up in the clean air of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), deep in Germany\xE2\x80\x99s south-west corner. The days and nights of his childhood were filled with music, either liberated from his parents\xE2\x80\x99 collection, absorbed via his bedside radio or tentatively played on the household\xE2\x80\x99s piano. He first heard DJs at youth discos and was smitten, immediately beginning his own record collection - Italian disco, the Pet Shop Boys, extended 12\xE2\x80\x9D mixes of pop tracks and classic funk are its foundations."

        content: "Michael Nyman (born March 23, 1944) is a British <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/minimalist\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">minimalist</a> composer, pianist, librettist and musicologist, perhaps best known for the many scores he wrote during his lengthy collaboration with the British filmmaker Peter Greenaway.\n \n Nyman, who had studied with the noted Baroque music scholar <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thurston+Dart\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Thurston Dart</a> at King's College <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/london\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">london</a>, drew frequently on early music sources in his scores for Greenaway's films: <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Purcell\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Henry Purcell</a> in The Draughtsman's Contract and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Heinrich+Ignaz+Franz+von+Biber\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber</a> in A Zed and Two Noughts, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mozart\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mozart</a> in Drowning by Numbers, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Dowland\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">John Dowland</a> in Prospero's Books.\n \n Nyman's popularity increased significantly after he wrote the score to Jane Campion's award-winning 1993 film The Piano. The album (&quot;<a title=\"Michael Nyman - The Piano\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Nyman/The+Piano\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Piano</a>&quot;) became a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/classical\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">classical</a> music best-seller. Although Nyman's score was central to the movie he did not receive an Academy Award nomination despite being nominated for both a British Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He has scored numerous other films, the vast majority of them art films from Europe. His few forays into Hollywood composing have been Gattaca (&quot;<a title=\"Michael Nyman - Gattaca\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Nyman/Gattaca\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Gattaca</a>&quot;), Ravenous (with musician <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damon+Albarn\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Damon Albarn</a>), and The End of the Affair (&quot;<a title=\"Michael Nyman - The End of The Affair\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Nyman/The+End+of+The+Affair\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The End of The Affair</a>&quot;).\n \n Among Nyman's better known non-film works are Noises, Sounds &amp; Sweet Airs (1987), for soprano, alto, tenor and instrumental ensemble (based on Nyman's score for La Princesse de Milan); Ariel Songs (1990) for soprano and band; MGV (Musique \xC3\xA0 Grande Vitesse) (1993) for band; concertos for piano (based on The Piano score), harpsichord, trombone and saxophone; the opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), based on a case-study by Oliver Sacks; and several string quartets.\n \n On children's television shows, Michael has created the music for Katie and Orbie and Titch.\n \n Many of Nyman's works are written for his own ensemble, the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Michael+Nyman+Band\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Nyman Band</a>, a group formed for a 1976 production of <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Carlo Goldonip</span>'s Il Campiello. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the saxophone in order to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified lineup of string quartet, three saxophones, bass trombone, bass guitar and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works.\n \n Nyman also wrote an influential book in 1974 on experimental music called Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond, which explored the influence of John Cage on classical composers. He is generally acknowledged to have been the first to apply the term &quot;<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/minimalism\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">minimalism</a>&quot; to music, in a 1968 article in The Spectator magazine about the English composer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cornelius+Cardew\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Cornelius Cardew</a>.\n \n In the 1970s, Nyman was a member of the infamous Portsmouth Sinfonia, the self-described World's Worst Orchestra - playing on their recordings and in their concerts.\n \n He has also recorded pop music, with the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Flying+Lizards\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Flying Lizards</a>"

          <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong> is a dreamy noise/psychedelic band formed in 1984 in Dublin, Ireland. The band's best known lineup is Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar), Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar), Debbie Googe (bass) and Colm O'Ciosoig (drums). Shields and O'Ciosoig are the only original members of the band still in the group. In 1991, the band released their second full length album &quot;Loveless&quot;, later declared one of the finest albums of the 1990s. The band struggled to record a follow up album and split in 1997. The band reunited in 2007 and performed several concerts the following year.
           
           The band's key member is guitarist/singer/composer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Shields" class="bbcode_artist">Kevin Shields</a>, a reclusive perfectionist and radically inventive guitarist/engineer. The band's other original member is drummer/studio maven Colm O'Ciosoig; during their heyday MBV also included singer-guitarist Bilinda Butcher and bassist Debbie Googe. Their band shares its name with a low-budget Canadian slasher film.  
           
           Though they released a handful of EPs during the mid-1980s, only their two official albums <a title="My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything" href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Isn%27t+Anything" class="bbcode_album">Isn't Anything</a> (1988) and <a title="My Bloody Valentine - Loveless" href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless" class="bbcode_album">Loveless</a> (1991), are considered representative of their sound: a distinct blend of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/noise%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">noise rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">ambient</a>, and off-kilter <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/melodic%20pop" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">melodic pop</a>. The songs were written by Shields, except for <a title="My Bloody Valentine &ndash; Touched" href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/_/Touched" class="bbcode_track">Touched</a>, a short instrumental by Colm O'Ciosoig. In 1999 <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" rel="nofollow">Pitchfork Media</a> declared Loveless to be the greatest album of the 1990s; however in their 2003 revision of the list, it moved down to number two, swapping places with <a title="Radiohead - OK Computer" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer" class="bbcode_album">OK Computer</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Shields" class="bbcode_artist">Kevin Shields</a> has also been noted by Alan McGee as <em>&quot;a genius artist. A visionary.&quot;</em>, whilst an <a href="http://www.nme.com" rel="nofollow">NME</a> review of Loveless declared, <em>&quot;...however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong>, failings and all, deserve more than your respect.&quot;</em>
           
           After leaving Creation Records in 1992 and signing with <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Island+Records/" class="bbcode_label">Island Records</a>, the band fell into a creative black hole. Rumors spread among their fans of albums being recorded and then shelved. Debbie Googe left the band to form <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Snowpony" class="bbcode_artist">Snowpony</a>; she had not played bass on their recordings since You Made Me Realise. Colm O'Ciosoig eventually left and formed a band with Hope Sandoval, formerly of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mazzy+Star" class="bbcode_artist">Mazzy Star</a>, called <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Hope%2BSandoval%2B%2526%2BThe%2BWarm%2BInventions" class="bbcode_artist">Hope Sandoval &amp; The Warm Inventions</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Shields" class="bbcode_artist">Kevin Shields</a> sporadically collaborated with other artists, most notably <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Experimental+Audio+Research" class="bbcode_artist">Experimental Audio Research</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Curve" class="bbcode_artist">Curve</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Scream" class="bbcode_artist">Primal Scream</a>. He revealed in a fall 2003 National Public Radio interview that Island Records quit financing his <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong> endeavors after he spent half a million pounds of their money.
           
           As of 2006, many rumors mentioned the possible reformation of <strong>My Bloody Valentine</strong> for a new studio album, but none of these were true. In January 2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Shields" class="bbcode_artist">Kevin Shields</a> quoted to media outlets that MBV would release another album, though dates have not yet been mentioned.  He has contributed music to the soundtracks of two Sofia Coppola films to date, <em>Lost In Translation</em> and <em>Marie Antoinette</em>.
           
           Influences include <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground" class="bbcode_artist">The Velvet Underground</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth" class="bbcode_artist">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins" class="bbcode_artist">Cocteau Twins</a>, late-1970s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Wire" class="bbcode_artist">Wire</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The%2BJesus%2B%2526%2BMary%2BChain" class="bbcode_artist">The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain</a>, and independent artists such as the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pastels" class="bbcode_artist">Pastels</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Shields" class="bbcode_artist">Kevin Shields</a> has also named <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys" class="bbcode_artist">The Beach Boys</a> as a personal influence.
           
           As of Autumn 2007 rumours of a possible reunion concert at the 2008 Coachella Festival in late April 2008 surfaced with prospects of a new album and world tour to follow. Later through various media sites Kevin confirmed at least 2 new albums are to be released as soon as the end of 2007.  As of December 2008, no new material has been released.
           
           It was announced on November 15th 2007 that the band would return to the live stage in summer 2008 with three gigs in London, Manchester and Glasgow respectively. When the tickets went on sale the next day they sold out in just over an hour for all three dates. Four additional shows were immediately added, at the same UK venues. 
           
           The band have also confirmed that they are returning to their Irish roots to headline the 2008 Electric Picnic festival in Stradbally, Ireland.
           
           MBV will headline Bestival on the Isle of Wight on Friday 5th September 2008.
           
           They have also scheduled a handful of US tourdates in New York, LA, Chicago and San Francisco for the end of September 2008.

          <strong>Neil Young</strong> was born in Toronto, Ontario, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Canada" class="bbcode_place">Canada</a> on November 12, 1945. He is a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">singer-songwriter</a> with a long and extensive musical career. He has become one of the most respected and influential musicians of his generation.
           
           Neil started his professional music career in the mid-1960's with a number of bands in Canada, notably the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mynah+Birds" class="bbcode_artist">Mynah Birds</a>, which also included fellow future <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Buffalo+Springfield" class="bbcode_artist">Buffalo Springfield</a> bassist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Palmer" class="bbcode_artist">Bruce Palmer</a> and future funk star <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+James" class="bbcode_artist">Rick James</a>. When the Mynah Birds broke up, Young and Palmer headed to California to meet <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Stills" class="bbcode_artist">Stephen Stills</a>, whom he had met in Thunder Bay, and the result was <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Buffalo+Springfield" class="bbcode_artist">Buffalo Springfield</a>. That band split up after three albums, and Neil soon started his solo career with the release of <em><a title="Neil Young - Neil Young" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Neil+Young" class="bbcode_album">Neil Young</a></em>  November 12, 1968. The album did not do very well commercially, but included several strong tracks, including &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; The Loner" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/The+Loner" class="bbcode_track">The Loner</a></em>&quot;, said to be a portrait of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Stills" class="bbcode_artist">Stephen Stills</a>. On May 14, 1969 he recruited  <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Crazy%2BHorse">Crazy Horse</a> and made the critically acclaimed <em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/Everybody+Knows+This+Is+Nowhere" class="bbcode_album">Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</a></em>. This was a much more consistent album,  the first to introduce longstanding collaborators Crazy Horse, and built around the balanced interplay between the guitars of Young, and the talented Danny Whitten.  The album also featured two lengthy classics, &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse &ndash; Down By The River" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/_/Down+By+The+River" class="bbcode_track">Down By The River</a></em>&quot; and &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse &ndash; Cowgirl In The Sand" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil%2BYoung%2B%2526%2BCrazy%2BHorse/_/Cowgirl+In+The+Sand" class="bbcode_track">Cowgirl In The Sand</a></em>&quot;, but it was <em><a title="Neil Young - Harvest" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Harvest" class="bbcode_album">Harvest</a></em> in 1972 that would make Neil Young into a well-known star with his first solo hit &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Heart of Gold" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Heart+of+Gold" class="bbcode_track">Heart of Gold</a></em>&quot;.
           
           During this time he also enjoyed considerable success as a quarter of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Crosby%252C%2BStills%252C%2BNash%2B%2526%2BYoung" class="bbcode_artist">Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young</a>. 
           
           Neil's subsequent work has zig-zagged across genres - dabbling in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">country rock</a> on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Old Ways" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Old+Ways" class="bbcode_track">Old Ways</a></em>&quot;; electronics on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Trans" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Trans" class="bbcode_track">Trans</a></em>&quot;; hooking up with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shocking+Pinks" class="bbcode_artist">Shocking Pinks</a> in a homage to old-time Rock 'n' Roll on &quot;<em><a title="Neil Young &ndash; Everybody's Rockin'" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Everybody%27s+Rockin%27" class="bbcode_track">Everybody's Rockin'</a></em>&quot;; creating a wall of feedback on the live <em>Arc-Weld</em>; and cementing his status as Godfather of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">grunge</a> when collaborating with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam" class="bbcode_artist">Pearl Jam</a> on <em><a title="Pearl Jam - Mirrorball" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/Mirrorball" class="bbcode_album">Mirrorball</a></em>.
           
           His idiosyncratic approach to genre even led to him being sued by his record company (<a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Geffen/" class="bbcode_label">Geffen</a>) in the 80's for making &quot;uncharacteristic&quot; music.
           
           Young has also dabbled in film, most recently on the album/concert series/dvd <em><a title="Neil Young - Greendale" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Greendale" class="bbcode_album">Greendale</a></em>. 
           
           60 years and still going strong the very special and often strange Neil Young keeps on making music. His latest release is <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Chrome+Dreams+II">Chrome Dreams II.</a></em> 
           
           The film Canadian Bacon includes the line &quot;Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to ruin our lives. The metric system, for the love of God! Celsius! Neil Young!&quot;

          The New Year is an indie rock band, formed in 1999, a year after the demise of the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bedhead" class="bbcode_artist">Bedhead</a> by former Bedhead members Bubba and Matt Kadane.
           
           Like Bedhead in its later years, The New Year has no real base of operations, but consists of members who live in many locations all over America convene every few years to record and tour. The band consists of brothers Matt and Bubba Kadane (located respectively in Ithaca, New York and Dallas and formerly of Bedhead), Mike Donofrio (of the band Saturnine, located in New York), Josh McKay (of the Athens, Georgia band Macha), Peter Schmidt (located in Dallas, formerly of the bands Three on a Hill, Funland and the Legendary Crystal Chandelier) and Chris Brokaw (in Boston, formerly of the bands Codeine and Come).
           
           The New Year was originally intended to be a two-person project made up of only the Kadane brothers. Donofrio, McKay, Schmidt, and Brokaw, all longtime friends of the Kadanes, were slowly recruited for live performances and the lineup solidified.
           
           In 2000, The New Year recorded their first album, Newness Ends, in Chicago, with Steve Albini (who had previously recorded the final Bedhead album &quot;Transaction De Novo&quot;); it was released in February 2001 on Touch &amp; Go Records. Because the lineup wasn't complete at the time of its recording, not everyone credited on the album (namely Schmidt) actually played on it. The album garnered much critical praise and comparison to the Kadanes' previous work. The Kadanes said in interviews at the time that they felt the only real difference between Bedhead and The New Year was the name and that if Bedhead had not disbanded, their next album would have sounded very similar Newness Ends.
           
           After a short tour to support Newness Ends the members separated again and almost everyone worked on other projects. The Kadanes recorded a score for the documentary film Hell House, the soundtrack of which wasn't released until 2004, though the film first appeared in 2001. Brokaw released solo recordings, played on recordings by Evan Dando and Consonant and collaborated on a project with playwright Rinde Eckert. Peter Schmidt played with the Legendary Crystal Chandelier, whose second and final album, Beyond Indifference, was released at about the same time as Newness Ends.
           
           In 2003 the members regrouped as The New Year to record the material that would become the album The End Is Near. The album, released by Touch &amp; Go Records in May 2004, was again recorded by Steve Albini. The band filmed a music video (a first for the Kadanes) for the song &quot;Disease&quot; to accompany the album.
           
           The brothers have announced that a third The New Year record will be released on September 9, 2008 after nearly four years of inactivity.
        summary: The New Year is an indie rock band, formed in 1999, a year after the demise of the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bedhead" class="bbcode_artist">Bedhead</a> by former Bedhead members Bubba and Matt Kadane.

          <strong>Oneida</strong> is a rock band from Brooklyn, New York. Their influences include psychedelic rock, krautrock, and hard rock, but the overall structure and intent of their music cannot be easily traced to any of these styles, or the myriad other styles they have drawn upon in recordings.
           
           The most striking and consistent aspect of Oneida's music is their use of and fascination with repetition. Their 2002 LP, Each One Teach One, for instance, begins with two especially long tracks, Sheets of Easter and Antiobiotics, the former over fourteen minutes long, the latter more than sixteen. Both of these songs are composed of one repeated riff (with a few short interludes on Antiobiotics). In addition to the use of repetition Oneida's music can be distinguished by the bandmember's extensive use of and enthusiasm for antique keyboards and analog electric pianos. 
           
           Originally recording on Turnbuckle (their first two albums in 1997 and 1999), the band now runs Brah Records, an imprint of Jagjaguwar(<a href="http://www.last.fm/group/JAGJAGuwar">Jagjaguwar group at Last.fm</a>). In September 2007 the group celebrated 10 years of existence with a concert at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in NYC.
           
           The current lineup is:
               * Kid Millions - drums, vocals participated as drummer 53 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7th, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.
               * Bobby Matador - organ, guitar, vocals
               * Hanoi Jane - guitar, bass
               * Double Rainbow (aka Phil Manley of Trans Am and The Fucking Champs) - guitar
               * Shahin Motia (of Ex Models) - guitar
           
           Papa Crazy (aka PCRZ) of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oakley+Hall" class="bbcode_artist">Oakley Hall</a> is a former member of Oneida, and has revived connections with Oneida by recording OH's most recent album <a title="Oakley Hall - Gypsum Strings" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oakley+Hall/Gypsum+Strings" class="bbcode_album">Gypsum Strings</a> on Oneida's Brah Records label.

Their 2002 LP, Each One Teach One, for instance, begins with two especially long tracks, Sheets of Easter and Antiobiotics, the former over fourteen minutes long, the latter more than sixteen.

In 1978, all Phoenix members except for Mircea Baniciu, the lead vocal, left the country in a dangerous escape, hidden in the large speakers they used in their concerts, placed in a truck, while the only member who could leave the country was driving the truck. The band continued its activity outside Romania, although not with the same success. After the Romanian revolution 1989, Phoenix returned and continued to give concerts.

Spicer and Matthew \xE2\x80\x98the Woodman\xE2\x80\x99 Woodley had begun playing together in high-school bands. The sea winds eventually carried them through the vast plains of Quebec to Montreal (a journey they would come to know intimately as the years wore on). It was in the now hallowed halls of Concordia University\xE2\x80\x99s music department that they would come upon Nicolas Basque, a strange francophone native that shared their musical inclinations (and a trappeur\xE2\x80\x99s finely-tuned taste in cuisine). It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t until then that the three boys became men, signified their union with a name, and that Plants and Animals emerged from the wildlife.\n \n In 2003 they bat out an instrumental menagerie of song-like folk-beasts, and put some of them to tape in the form of a recording that local label Ships at Night would later release. By 2005 the three young men were taming the sprawling wilderness of their sound and sculpting real songs, as Spicer also lead the way to a (hitherto unheard of) vocal domination of their material\xE2\x80\x94as if he had been possessed by the ghost of some recently departed soul singer. During this time Spicer and Woodley would occasionally stop by to care for some of the neighbours\xE2\x80\x94Timber, Socalled, and Katie Moore\xE2\x80\x94and play. All the while, the Halifax-born were jamming and pruning with Basque, harnessing the band and its songs like a wild horse. Some called it post-classic-rock. Some called it folk-prog. Those who knew better didn\xE2\x80\x99t say anything at all.\n \n In about the summer of 2005 they carried a 24-track Studer \xE2\x80\x9Cbull\xE2\x80\x9D up the stairs of Spicer\xE2\x80\x99s apartment and split their time between their new makeshift studio there (aka Le Carillon Tropical), and the Treatment Room. By fall 2006 the foundations of what would later become Parc Avenue were layed, the band was playing shows (and singing), and a relationship with Montreal label Secret City Records was formed. By summer 2007 the once-monster was complete, temporarily tamed, housed, and ready to be unleashed.\n \n While the band awaited the release of Parc Avenue, they kept busy touring in the US, Canada, and Iceland, working on their album art and recording with/avec EP that was released in Canada in October 2007.

          Shellac (sometimes referred to as '<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Shellac+Of+North+America" class="bbcode_artist">Shellac Of North America</a>') is an <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/america" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">america</a>n rock music group formed in <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/illinois" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">illinois</a>, in 1992 by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini" class="bbcode_artist">Steve Albini</a> (guitar and vocals), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Weston" class="bbcode_artist">Bob Weston</a> (bass guitar vocals) and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Todd+Trainer" class="bbcode_artist">Todd Trainer</a> (drums). They have been classified as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/noise%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">noise rock</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">math rock</a>. Albini has claimed they refer to themselves as 'Shellac of North America', &quot;when we're being pretentious.&quot;
           
           They have a distinctive, minimalist sound based on unusual and urgent time signatures, repetitive heavy rhythms, an angular guitar sound, and Albini's surreal, bitingly sarcastic lyrics. Songs typically do not have traditional verse/chorus/verse structure and the arrangements are sparse, to the point where some describe them as &quot;amelodic&quot;. Shellac's signature sound is often associated with their enthusiasm for vintage Travis Bean guitars, a rare brand of aluminium-based instruments. Albini is also known to use copper plectrums and unique guitar straps that fit around the waist rather than over the shoulder. The band prefers the intimacy of smaller clubs, and live appearances are sporadic.
           
           Both Weston and Albini are renowned recording engineers, and use their preferred methods with Shellac: Albini prefers a very clean, analogue recording sound with little or no overdubbing, and he is meticulous about microphone placings and equipment - this is reflected in Shellac's no nonsense approach to their own music, both in the studio and live.
           
           Shellac are also renowned for their unconventional modus operandi. Touring is often an excuse for the band to take time away from their day jobs (Albini and Weston are both recording engineers; Trainer works at a commercial photographer's studio in Minneapolis) instead of being used to promote a recent record or even for financial gain. Indeed, Shellac do not have a &quot;fixed fee&quot; for performances like most bands, instead preferring to take the door charge minus expenses such as promotion, running costs and venue fees. They have also been known to ask venues to remove ticket charges they regard as unnecessary, which have become common in Europe and America.
           
           An early claim from the band was that all of their songs were about two of Albini's favourite subjects: Baseball and Canada. In actuality, Albini and Weston's songs can refer to a broad range of topics, from the highly emotional to examinations of everyday minutiae. However, regardless of the subject, each song is presented in the same deadpan, occasionally violent manner. An example can be found in the concluding tracks from the band's album <a title="Shellac - 1000 Hurts" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/1000+Hurts" class="bbcode_album">1000 Hurts</a>. Although both songs have a title referring to a mundane house-hold object, these items are in actuality symbolic of a larger theme. Weston's &quot;<a title="Shellac &ndash; Shoe Song" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Shoe+Song" class="bbcode_track">Shoe Song</a>&quot; deals with the realisation of love and its subsequent loss, whereas Albini's &quot;<a title="Shellac &ndash; Watch Song" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Watch+Song" class="bbcode_track">Watch Song</a>&quot; details irrational anger and aggression. Shoe Song also heavily references post-rock band Slint, who were produced by Albini.
           
           Shellac are known for their mercurial nature, which has produced some interesting records and events. Most notably, they recorded an instrumental album known as <a title="Shellac - The Futurist" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/The+Futurist" class="bbcode_album">The Futurist</a> for a modern dance troupe. Unwilling to grant what the band considered a sub-par recording a wider audience, they pressed approximately 700 vinyl LP copies of the music and gave them away as gifts to friends. The front cover was a list of the recipients, with the relevant name encircled. Shellac also played a Halloween show as the anarchic British punk group The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sex+Pistols" class="bbcode_artist">Sex Pistols</a>, featuring former The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jesus+Lizard" class="bbcode_artist">Jesus Lizard</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Scratch+Acid" class="bbcode_artist">Scratch Acid</a> singer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Yow" class="bbcode_artist">David Yow</a> as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Rotten" class="bbcode_artist">Johnny Rotten</a>. Both of the aforementioned can now be found on several file-sharing networks.
           
           In 2002, the band was also responsible for curating the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/england" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">england</a>. Amongst fans of independent rock, these weekends have achieved legendary status and featured performances from some of the world's finest groups. Knowing that most of the audience had come specifically to see Shellac, the band went on first every morning as an incentive for the festival-goers to be up in time to see the other acts.  An album of live tracks from this festival was also released on <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/atp%20records" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">atp records</a>.
           
           In December 2004, Shellac recorded a final BBC Session dedicated their longtime fan <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Peel" class="bbcode_artist">John Peel</a>. Peel had been an ardent supporter of the band and his death earlier in the year came as a great shock to the independent music community. In 2005, Shellac were recorded playing '<a title="Shellac &ndash; Steady As She Goes" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Shellac/_/Steady+As+She+Goes" class="bbcode_track">Steady As She Goes</a>' in an abandoned house as part of a film project called Burn To Shine, organised by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi" class="bbcode_artist">Fugazi</a> drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brendan+Canty" class="bbcode_artist">Brendan Canty</a> and film-maker <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Christoph Green</span>. This is the only available recorded video footage of the band playing live.
           
           Excellent Italian Greyhound is the latest Shellac release.
           
           The first half could be a holy affirmation, and maybe short of &quot;Prayer to God&quot; features the band's best opening track. &quot;The End of Radio&quot; is a minimalist three-chord funeral march for (you guessed it) radio, as Albini assumes the character of the last DJ (and man) on earth, screaming dedications to a deserted planet. While the vocals aren't as foaming as they've been during live performances, the more desperate and pathetic tone fits this clever conceit. Albini errantly lets out nervous patter and thanks non-existent sponsors before wailing, &quot;Can you hear me now???&quot; and letting loose with the crackling guitar lines we love Shellac for. &quot;Steady as She Goes&quot; is another live staple finally seeing release, exemplary of the thin, metallic chug they've patented, though it's without the tension or left turns of their earlier work.
           
           The band saves the stretching out for side two. &quot;Lulabelle&quot; is undoubtedly the strangest and most difficult track to get through: Its heavy riffage is interrupted by a long segment of the Sinatra-like crooning of some pretty unsettling lyrics, plus voice overs by Ken Nordine and Strongbad. The juxtaposition is hilarious and disturbing, and while you may never play it more than a few times, it's the most confrontational the band gets on this record, as well as closest in spirit to At Action Park or Albini's former projects. &quot;Boycott&quot; is a quick-and-dirty anti-capitalist rant from Weston, and though the metronome tick of the instrumental &quot;Kittypants&quot; strikes me as filler, the other instrumental, &quot;Paco&quot;, is a vicious highlight with atmosphere that's as sparse and evocative as an Ennio Morricone score. The odd interlude that introduces &quot;Spoke&quot; gives way to straight-up punk rock with unintelligible screaming from both Weston and Albini. I can't help but feel like the joke's on the listener here, but it's hard not to smile at it.
           
           
           The haters and the whiners have asked me to tell you that this Shellac record, their first new effort in seven years, has a long song on it where instrumentation stops outright. During this song, Steve Albini sings a capella, joined in vocal commentary by Ken Nordine and Internet villain Strong Bad. Apparently this is even more shocking than the first, long, repetitive song on Terraform or that song about squirrels on 1000 Hurts . If something like this bothers you, maybe you should be looking for another record.
           
           It's baffling what listeners expect out of this project. History has proven that Shellac is not a primary career outlet for any of its members, who have full-time jobs and are fortunate enough to be able to play music for an attentive audience when their schedules allow. You get a record whenever they find the time to make one, and maybe a year later you get the opportunity to see them live. The wait between albums, sadly, serves as somewhat of a countercultural cul-de-sac for its fans. It makes sense, though; they scratch an itch with specialized, raw, primal strokes, brought about by unique and rarefied instruments that only they possess. Albini's guitar has never sounded so rich and burnished as it does here, every sinuous scrape transmitted with detail and control. Bob Weston and Todd Trainer fill out a rhythm section that understands the beauty in space and restraint. Lyrically this one's as vague as any other Shellac record, but musically they've entered a stage of strong, fulfilled, and aggressive songwriting that eclipses damn near all of their output since the initial singles and debut album. &quot;Steady as She Goes,&quot; &quot;Be Prepared,&quot; and &quot;Paco&quot; alone will satisfy just about every fan looking to get their kicks, and &quot;Genuine Lulabelle&quot; and &quot;The End of Radio&quot; will serve as points to drive everyone else pretty crazy. Plus they finally got around to fitting set closer &quot;Spoke&quot; on record, which completes all required documentation on Shellac's early career. Whether you view this as a closing of the books or the dawn of a new era for the band is up to you, but this is easily Shellac's second best album, and inevitably for a lot of you, it will be the soundtrack to your summer of 2007.

Skateb\xC3\xA5rd conjured a blend of retro-electro, techno to even instrumental\n hip-hop that made a massive mark on the dance community. Getting the better of his ego and seeing the struggles of success faced with his musical comrades in the community, Skateb\xC3\xA5rd opted to keep a low profile, yet anything but disappeared.\n He has gone on to release a steady string of treasured releases on Keys Of Life/S\xC3\xA4hk\xC3\xB6 and the cult label Sex Tags Mania.

But now it's 2006 and times have changed for young Skateb\xC3\xA5rd as he moves back to the spotlight in the boldest of ways having opted away from the opportunities of the larger label machine, he has chosen the path of independent freedom by launching his own imprint DIGITALO ENTERPRISES"
        summary: "Bergen, Norway (2002-present)  Skateb\xC3\xA5rd (you can call him Skateboard) is another fascinating member of the remarkable Bergen, Norwegian music scene; yes the same magical home of Sondre Lerche, Kings Of Convenience, R\xC3\xB6yksopp and Annie.\n  This offbeat lad began his adventure in music upon the release of his 2002 debut Skateboarding Was A Crime (in 1989) on the legendary Tell\xC3\xA9 electro subsidiary imprint Tellektro. Skateb\xC3\xA5rd conjured a blend of retro-electro, techno to even instrumental\n "

          Sleepy Sun is an apt title for this young San Francisco sextet, as their debut record, &quot;Embrace&quot;, is one of those rare slabs of rock and roll that will wake you up in the morning, and send you off to sleep at night. After honing their craft in the occult influenced creative community of Santa Cruz, the band has continued to grow, both creatively and in their loyal following, since their relocation to the city by the bay. With their throbbing rhythm section, swirling sea of guitars, and dreamy, haunting duet vocals, the word dynamic is a severe understatement.
           
           Though the press is quick to rifle off a laundry list of rock's greatest ghosts to describe their sound, one live show is all you need to know Sleepy Sun have stumbled upon something very much their own. Having performed their raw, high-energy show on stages shared with acts such as Howlin' Rain, Earth, Dead Meadow, and Citay, they are quickly establishing themselves as a very tough act to follow. Fans at shows are known for shouting the band's battle cry, &quot;Let's get weird&quot;. If the group continues down their rapid road to success, things are about to get very weird indeed.

        content: "There is more than one artist with this name. \n \n <strong>1) Spectrum</strong> is a project of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Kember\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Peter Kember</a>, a British musician more usually known as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Boom\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Sonic Boom</a>, and founding member of the band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Spacemen 3</a>. Sonic Boom's first solo album, <em>Spectrum</em>, was recorded in 1989 while Spacemen 3 were still together, and featured the other members of the group. However, when Spacemen 3 disbanded in 1991, Kember recruited new musicians for the group Spectrum.\n \n Initial Spectrum releases carried on from the sound of late-period Spacemen 3, featuring conventional songs and a regular band. First single &quot;How You Satisfy Me&quot; was an original composition reminiscent of 1960s garage bands. 1992's Soul Kiss (Glide Divine) was split between songs and longer experimental pieces featuring drones and repetition, and Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows (1994) was also mainly song-oriented. Occasionally <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jessamine\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jessamine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Silver+Apples\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Silver Apples</a> have collaborated with Kember using the Spectrum name. \n \n From 1996 the name has been used for Kember's solo work, usually with Pete Bassman (Pete Bain) from the original Spacemen 3 lineup and recording engineer/musician Alf Hardy. This material was often in the same vein as Kember's <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Experimental+Audio+Research\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Experimental Audio Research</a> project, reflecting an increased interest in vintage analogue synthesizers, especially those made by EMS. A new album is being recording with Randall Nieman of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/F%C3%BCxa/\">Fuxa</a>, though on hold due to other recording and live commitments.\n \n As of 2009 Spectrum is back as a full band line up consisting off Sonic, guitarist Kev, bass guitarist Nolan and Dino on Drums.\n \n <strong>2) Spectrum</strong> is an Australian band from the early 1970's.\n Australian Spectrum was the brain-child of the eccentric song-writer Mike Rudd and his bassist mate, Bill Putt. They had limitted success commercially and remained an underground band. In the mid 70's they formed a more commercial unit called Indelible Murtceps (Spectrum spelt backwards) and often played a double set, one as Spectrum one as Murtceps.\n \n Rudd and Putt went on to form another more commercially successful band, Ariel, in the late 70's.\n \n Spectrum are best remembered by their one big hit - &quot;I'll Be Gone&quot;, which has been covered by many Australian musicians including Chain and John Williamson.\n \n <strong>3) Spectrum</strong> was an early 1970s Brazilian band.  They recorded one LP in 1971, called &quot;Gera\xC3\xA7\xC3\xA3o Bendita&quot;.  It falls into the &quot;tropicalia&quot; movement of the era.  The songs have similarity to bands like Os Mutantes as well as early 1970s British and American bands.\n \n <strong>4) Spectrum</strong> is an Israeli psychedelic trance project which was founded back in 2001 (as well as <a href=\"http://www.spectrum-records.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spectrum records</a> label) by Israel's leading, veteran Dj and one of its most influential figures, Dj Dede.\n \n Dede has been active in the local and international scenes since the early psychedelic trance days, throwing free beach parties in 1992, and co-founding the legendary MDMA Records and Distribution in 1997.\n \n Dede's unique powerful and uplifting style can be recaptured while listening to the various CD compilations he has compiled. Spectrum records concept is Dede's vision of the future of trance and its electronic siblings. Discovering those incredible talents and following them through.The Spectrum sound has been molded after experimenting with all trance grooves and can be best described as uplifting, touching yet powerful and juicy dance floor hits.\n \n <strong>5) Spectrum</strong>\n The Spectrum were a manufactured group,  put together by British RCA to see if it was possible come up with a British equivalent of the Monkees.   Despite exposure due to their feature in the closing credits of &quot;Captain Scarlet &amp; the Mysterons&quot;,  they never had any luck in their own country.  \n \n  \n \n The Spectrum made their debut with a single of &quot;Samantha's Mine&quot; and &quot;Saturday's Child,&quot; issued in early 1967; it became more popular in Spain (reaching the number one spot) than it was in England. Their second single, &quot;Portabello Road,&quot; was picked up by Radio London, the top pirate radio outlet in England, and played very heavily, however failing to make the chart. Their third single, &quot;Headin' for a Heatwave,&quot; hit number one in Spain, and their fifth single, a cover of &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,&quot; reached the top spot in Germany during 1968. \n \n  Singing the title song in the end credits of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; failed to get them any significant sales, and the song was never issued commercially.  Iironically,  their presence on the title theme did give the group a bit of exposure in America, but they never were able to take advantage of this.\n In the following years, after many changes within the group, they recorded two additional single and a LP entitled &quot;The Light is Dark Enough&quot;, for RCA - after which the troup moved to Parlophone for one last single before they split up.\n \n Keith Forsey continued to play drums with other artists, and became a major songwriter - co-authoring  &quot;Flashdance (What a Feeling)&quot; and &quot;Don't You Forget About Me&quot;, and several other movie soundtracks. \n \n \n "
        summary: "There is more than one artist with this name.   1) Spectrum is a project of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Kember\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Peter Kember</a>, a British musician more usually known as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Boom\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Sonic Boom</a>, and founding member of the band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Spacemen 3</a>.

          Spiritualized is an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3" class="bbcode_artist">Spacemen 3</a> outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.
           
           The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of <a title="The Troggs &ndash; Any Way That You Want Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Troggs/_/Any+Way+That+You+Want+Me" class="bbcode_track">Any Way That You Want Me</a> in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, <a title="Spiritualized - Lazer Guided Melodies" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Lazer+Guided+Melodies" class="bbcode_album">Lazer Guided Melodies</a>), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders" class="bbcode_artist">The Breeders</a> (and later <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lupine+Howl" class="bbcode_artist">Lupine Howl</a>), Refoy formed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Slipstream" class="bbcode_artist">Slipstream</a>(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Ashcroft" class="bbcode_artist">Richard Ashcroft</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Verve" class="bbcode_artist">The Verve</a>. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lupine+Howl" class="bbcode_artist">Lupine Howl</a> following summary dismissal by Pierce.
           
           Sax player Ray 'Moonshake' Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998.
           
           Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Cope" class="bbcode_artist">Julian Cope</a> string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Donor" class="bbcode_artist">Brain Donor</a> and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/solar+fire+trio" class="bbcode_artist">solar fire trio</a>. The remaining line-up finished recording the album <a title="Spiritualized - Songs in A&amp;E" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Songs%2Bin%2BA%2526E" class="bbcode_album">Songs in A&amp;E</a> in Nottingham and London.
           
           The style of Spiritualized is perhaps best described as <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">psychedelic rock</a>, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album <a title="My Bloody Valentine - Loveless" href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless" class="bbcode_album">Loveless</a>. The landmark <a title="Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Ladies+and+Gentlemen+We+Are+Floating+in+Space" class="bbcode_album">Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space</a> showed influences from African-American <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">gospel</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/blues" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">blues</a> beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Spector" class="bbcode_artist">Phil Spector</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Wilson</a> began to predominate, which came to a head on <a title="Spiritualized - Let It Come Down" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Let+It+Come+Down" class="bbcode_album">Let It Come Down</a>. <a title="Spiritualized - Amazing Grace" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Amazing+Grace" class="bbcode_album">Amazing Grace</a> favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/soul" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">soul</a> influences heavier than ever.
           
           For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized's then-label, Arista Records.
        summary: Spiritualized is an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3" class="bbcode_artist">Spacemen 3</a> outfit.

His first full-length work, Feed Me Weird Things (on Richard &quot;<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Aphex Twin</a>&quot; James' Rephlex label), was a dizzying, quixotic blend of superfast jungle breaks with Aphex-style synth textures, goofy, offbeat melodies, and instrumental arrangements (Jenkinson samples his own playing for his tracks) that recall vaguely <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jazz fusion</a> pioneers such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mahavishnu+Orchestra\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mahavishnu Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Weather+Report\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Weather Report</a>. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, Jenkinson's fretless accompaniment is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing).\n \n Jenkinson grew up listening to jazz and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dub\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">dub</a> greats like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Miles Davis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Augustus+Pablo\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Augustus Pablo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Charlie Parker</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Art Blakey</a>. The son of a jazz drummer, Jenkinson followed in his father's footsteps, playing bass and drums in high school. Introduced to electronic music through experimental <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electro\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">electro</a>-<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/techno\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">techno</a> artists such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/LFO\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">LFO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Craig\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Carl Craig</a>, Jenkinson soon began assembling the rolls of disparate influence into amalgams of breakbeat techno and post-bop avant-garde and progressive jazz. Claiming a closer affinity with jazz than <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jungle\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jungle</a> (although he draws from both equally in his music), Jenkinson's EPs as Squarepusher and the Duke of Harringay (Jenkinson moved to Harringay from his Chelmsford birthplace) were initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle's more obvious compositional principles, but found ready audience in fans of post-<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/acid%20house\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">acid house</a> experimental listening music. He inked a deal with Warp in 1995, releasing the Port Rhombus EP and three others through a variety of different labels. His full-length debut, Feed Me Weird Things, appeared in 1996, followed a year later by Hard Normal Daddy.\n \n Critical acclaim for Jenkinson's work peaked with 1998's Music Is Rotted One Note, for which he became a one-man fusion group -- multi-tracking himself playing drums, bass, and keyboards. The following year, he released two EPs (Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest) and another full LP, Selection Sixteen. Go Plastic appeared in summer 2001, featuring the closest thing to a hit Squarepusher had ever seen, with the single &quot;My Red Hot Car.&quot; Subsequent releases such as 2003's Do You Know Squarepusher and 2004's Ultravisitor found him refining his fusion of composition, programming, and musicianship.\n \n More recently, in 2008, Squarepusher released &quot;Just A Souvenir&quot;, in which he gives a more rock-influenced sound, using almost all organic instruments.\n \n Tom Jenkinson is also known as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+A.D.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chaos A.D.</a>\n \n His official website: <a href=\"http://www.squarepusher.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.squarepusher.net</a>\n "
        summary: "Born in 1975 (<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/Essex\">Essex</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/English%20Artists\">England</a>), Tom &quot;Squarepusher&quot; Jenkinson's innovative work spans almost every musical genre, although he is perhaps best known for his experimental <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%27n%27bass\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">drum'n'bass</a> with a heavy <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jazz fusion</a> influence.

          Throwing Muses is a post-punk alternative rock band formed in 1981 in Newport, Rhode Island, United States, that toured and recorded extensively until 1997, when its members began concentrating more on other projects. Originally fronted by two distinctive lead singers, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kristin+Hersh" class="bbcode_artist">Kristin Hersh</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tanya+Donelly" class="bbcode_artist">Tanya Donelly</a>, stepsisters who both wrote the group's songs, Throwing Muses are known for performing music with shifting tempos, creative chord progressions, unorthodox song structures, and surreal lyrics. The group was set apart from other contemporary acts by Hersh's stark, candid writing style; Donelly's pop stylings and vocal harmonies; and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Narcizo" class="bbcode_artist">David Narcizo</a>'s unusual drumming techniques eschewing use of cymbals. Hallucinatory, febrile songs by Hersh occasionally touched on the subject of mental illness, more often drawing portraits of characters from daily life or addressing relationships.
           
           Donelly left the band in 1991 and was a member of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders" class="bbcode_artist">The Breeders</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Belly" class="bbcode_artist">Belly</a>, before starting to perform solo.  She also contributed vocals to the Throwing Muses self-titled album in 2003.  Hersh has also worked solo, and currently fronts the power trio <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/50+Foot+Wave" class="bbcode_artist">50 Foot Wave</a> (which also includes Muses bassist Bernard Georges).  Narcizo works in graphic design and has a musical project <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lakuna" class="bbcode_artist">Lakuna</a>.

          The Vaselines were an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 1986, the band was originally made up of only Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretty+Flowers" class="bbcode_artist">The Pretty Flowers</a> with Duglas T. Stewart, Norman Blake and Sean Dickson. Eugene had formerly played in 'The Famous Monsters'.
           
           <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his &quot;most favorite songwriters in the whole world&quot;.
           
           The band released two singles, &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Son of a Gun" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Son+of+a+Gun" class="bbcode_track">Son of a Gun</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Dying for It" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Dying+for+It" class="bbcode_track">Dying for It</a>&quot;, prior to releasing an album. In 1989 they released their only album, <a title="The Vaselines - Dum Dum" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/Dum+Dum" class="bbcode_album">Dum Dum</a>, on the record label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Rough+Trade/" class="bbcode_label">Rough Trade</a>. Following the closing of the record label <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">53rd and 3rd</span>, which they had originally signed to, the band broke up in 1990. However, they reunited later that year to open for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> when they played in Edinburgh.
           
           Though they were not widely known when the band existed, covers of their songs by Nirvana and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain" class="bbcode_artist">Kurt Cobain</a>'s tendency to mention them as an influence brought exposure to the band. With their songs &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Molly's Lips" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Molly%27s+Lips" class="bbcode_track">Molly's Lips</a>&quot; covered on Nirvana's album Incesticide and &quot;<a title="The Vaselines &ndash; Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/_/Jesus+Wants+Me+For+A+Sunbeam" class="bbcode_track">Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam</a>&quot; covered as &quot;Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam&quot; on MTV Unplugged in New York, the band gained a new audience from people who wanted to discover the bands that influenced Cobain (a similar situation happened to the band The <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Puppets" class="bbcode_artist">Meat Puppets</a>). Due to this new exposure, in 1992 <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop/" class="bbcode_label">Sub Pop</a> released <a title="The Vaselines - The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines/The+Way+of+the+Vaselines%3A+A+Complete+History" class="bbcode_album">The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History</a>, a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work on one album.
           
           No longer together, members of the band moved on to new bands. Kelly went on to found the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Captain+America" class="bbcode_artist">Captain America</a> (later renamed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eugenius" class="bbcode_artist">Eugenius</a>). He currently performs solo. McKee founded the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Suckle" class="bbcode_artist">Suckle</a> and released her first solo album, Sunny Moon, in 2006.
        summary: "The Vaselines were an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland.

          There are at least two bands called Vivian Girls;
           
           1) Disbanded Australian punk band from the 90s featuring Kody Abrams (Flesh Vs Venom, Bakelite, etc) and Sean Bailey (Lakes, etc)
           
           2) Although only a band for a little more than a year, the Vivian Girls charms have already worked their magic on their short road to &quot;out of nowhere&quot; status. With their irresistable mix of 60's <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/girl-group" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">girl-group</a> sounds, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">post-punk</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/shoegaze" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">shoegaze</a>, the 'Girls have mastered blurring the lines of genres and coming up with something aggressive yet beautiful; simple, gutsy music with a lot of class and melody. 
           
           But it's not so out-of-nowhere as it seems. Cassie Ramone (gtr, vocals) and Kickball Katy (bass, vocals, drums) were longtime friends from high school, so when Frankie Rose (drums, vocals, bass) and Cassie decided to start a band, Katy seemed the obvious choice to complete the lineup. Spurred on by sharing common (and uncommon) influences, the girls started writing material and playing live pretty quickly in their adopted hometown of Brooklyn. Within the first couple of months they had already developed a strong local following, supporting acts like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Reatard" class="bbcode_artist">Jay Reatard</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Japanther" class="bbcode_artist">Japanther</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/King%2BKhan%2B%2526%2BBBQ%2BShow" class="bbcode_artist">King Khan &amp; BBQ Show</a> as well as finding kindred spirits in other locals like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Crystal+Stilts" class="bbcode_artist">Crystal Stilts</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/caUSE+co-MOTION%21" class="bbcode_artist">caUSE co-MOTION!</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Woods" class="bbcode_artist">The Woods</a>, with whom they've shared many bills and helped develop a local scene. 
           
           Turning some heads at <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/516671">SXSW</a> and a few national tours this year, the 'Girls came back to NYC brandished with a new, powerful weapon: a killer debut single, <a title="Vivian Girls &ndash; Wild Eyes" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Vivian+Girls/_/Wild+Eyes" class="bbcode_track">Wild Eyes</a>, on the <span title="Unknown label" class="bbcode_unknown">Plays With Dolls</span> label. The record was a can't miss for even the snobbiest of music geeks, mixing the girl-group harmonies of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Shangri-Las" class="bbcode_artist">Shangri-Las</a>, the 'gaze-iness of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine" class="bbcode_artist">My Bloody Valentine</a>, and the urgency of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Wipers" class="bbcode_artist">Wipers</a>. Can't lose with that trifecta, and it's something they've proved over twelve inches as well as seven.. 
           
           Featuring an A-Side full of hope and a B-Side almost without any, the self-titled debut LP on <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Mauled+By+Tigers/" class="bbcode_label">Mauled By Tigers</a> stirred so much pandemonium on the internet that it sold out in just a few short days. Such a cohesive and fully-realized debut wouldn't be left to languish in the world of the &quot;Out-Of-Print&quot;, but don't fret! Even before it's release, it was picked up by indie/garage powerhouse <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/In+The+Red/" class="bbcode_label">In The Red</a> Records, former home of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Lips" class="bbcode_artist">Black Lips</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ponys" class="bbcode_artist">The Ponys</a> and Jay Reatard. With a repress on LP and CD due in the early Fall, the newly minted Vivian Girls obsessives can breathe a sigh of relief knowing it'll be available again. 
           
           With a single on up-and-coming indie <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Woodsist/" class="bbcode_label">Woodsist</a>, and another on new home In The Red, the 'Girls show no signs of stopping the assault on your heartstrings. With an upcoming year full of touring and recording a follow-up LP, expect to see the Vivian Girls working their charms not far from your house, your turntable or your neighbor's ears.
        summary: "There are at least two bands called Vivian Girls;  1) Disbanded Australian punk band from the 90s featuring Kody Abrams (Flesh Vs Venom, Bakelite, etc) and Sean Bailey (Lakes, etc)  2) Although only a band for a little more than a year, the Vivian Girls charms have already worked their magic on their short road to &quot;out of nowhere&quot; status. With their irresistable mix of 60's <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/girl-group\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">girl-group</a> sounds, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">punk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">post-punk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/shoegaze\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">shoegaze</a>, the 'Girls have mastered blurring the lines of genres and coming up with something aggressive yet beautiful; simple, gutsy music with a lot of class and melody.

Started as an experiment in rhythmic primitivism and group improvisation, the current lineup brings a more structured rock approach to its performances, utilizing a traditional lineup of drums (Omar Ahsanuddin), bass (Dusty Jermier), organ (Nash Whalen), guitar (Erik \xE2\x80\x9CRipley\xE2\x80\x9D Johnson) and vocals.\n \n Its songs sound something akin to the icy garage rock of early Echo &amp; The Bunnymen crossed with the sun-bleached tremolo-punk of the Scientists. There are hints of krautrock, the trance-inducing organ haze of Suicide, Deerhunter style dance-drone, classic desert-fried garage psych and the mysterious, obscure Japanese lysergic-rock band Les Rallizes Denudes all mixed into one explosive whole on Wooden Shjips self-titled Holy Mountain debut.\n \n The experience of Wooden Shjips has been equated to that of the Japanese phenomenon called maboroshi, which is somewhat similar to seeing a mirage or hallucinating in time. In the context of imagination/dreams, maboroshi is attributed to past occurrences and can take on a meaning like &quot;phantoms.&quot; The group's songs seem to exist in a dream state in which anything is possible.\n \n Wooden Shjips released two acclaimed records in 2006, beginning early in the year with the self-released 10\xE2\x80\x9D EP Shrinking Moon for You. The record quickly sold-out, after capturing the attention of well-regarded tastemakers, such as Tom Lax and Byron Coley, who penned rave reviews on Siltblog and in The Wire magazine, respectively. A 7\xE2\x80\x9D followed on the Sick Thirst label, and received similar praise from music bloggers, as well as from veteran scribe David Fricke in Rolling Stone.\n \n The band has three new releases lined up for 2007: the LP/CD for Holy Mountain, a 7\xE2\x80\x9D for Sub Pop and a 7\xE2\x80\x9D for Pollymaggoo Records. They played at NoisePop 2007 with Roky Erickson in March, as well as playing a packed showcase at the SXSW Music conference in Austin, TX."

        content: "The Hoboken, NJ-based unit explore the extremes of feedback-driven <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/noise%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">noise rock</a> and sweet melodic <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/pop\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">pop</a>. Prolific and independent, <strong>Yo La Tengo</strong> have transcended their influences to establish themselves as an institution of the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">indie</a> community.\n \n The core of Yo La Tengo (Spanish for the outfielder's cry of &quot;I've got it!&quot;) comprises husband and wife duo singer/guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ira+Kaplan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ira Kaplan</a> and drummer/vocalist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Georgia+Hubley\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Georgia Hubley</a>. After forming the band in 1984, they placed an advertisement seeking other musicians to round out the lineup, requesting applicants who shared their fondness for the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Soft+Boys\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Soft Boys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mission+of+Burma\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mission of Burma</a>, and Arthur Lee's <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Love\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Love</a>. A number of bassists and lead guitarists passed through the band's roster during its formative years, but after bowing in late 1985 with the single &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; The River of Water\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/The+River+of+Water\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The River of Water</a>,&quot; backed by a cover of Love's &quot;<a title=\"Love &ndash; A House Is Not a Motel\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Love/_/A+House+Is+Not+a+Motel\" class=\"bbcode_track\">A House Is Not a Motel</a>,&quot; Yo La Tengo's membership appeared to stabilize with the additions of guitarist Dave Schramm and bassist Mike Lewis prior to the sessions for 1986's full-length roots pop debut, &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Ride the Tiger\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Ride+the+Tiger\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Ride the Tiger</a>&quot;, produced by former Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley.\n \n However, both Schramm and Lewis exited in the wake of the record's release, leaving Kaplan to assume lead guitar duties. Bassist Stephan Wichnewski signed on for 1987's &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - New Wave Hot Dogs\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/New+Wave+Hot+Dogs\" class=\"bbcode_album\">New Wave Hot Dogs</a>, a more assured outing that brought the group's Velvet Underground obsession to the fore via a cover of the early VU composition &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; It's Alright (The Way That You Live)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/It%27s+Alright+%28The+Way+That+You+Live%29\" class=\"bbcode_track\">It's Alright (The Way That You Live)</a>.&quot; Not only did Kaplan's introverted, half-spoken vocals and buzzing guitar work closely recall <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Lou Reed</a>, but Hubley's rock-steady drumming and breathy backing turns simultaneously conjured memories of vintage <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maureen+Tucker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Maureen Tucker</a>. Even better was 1989's &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - President Yo La Tengo\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/President+Yo+La+Tengo\" class=\"bbcode_album\">President Yo La Tengo</a>&quot;, recorded with producer and guest bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Holder\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gene Holder</a>; opening with the droning squalls of the stunning &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Barnaby, Hardly Working\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Barnaby%2C+Hardly+Working\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Barnaby, Hardly Working</a>,&quot; the record spotlighted the group's sonic schizophrenia by including two Jekyll-and-Hyde versions of the track &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; The Evil That Men Do\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/The+Evil+That+Men+Do\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Evil That Men Do</a>&quot; -- one a gorgeous instrumental, the other a blistering feedback freakout.\n \n Schramm returned to the fold for 1990's &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Fakebook\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Fakebook\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Fakebook</a>&quot;, a remarkable <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/acoustic\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">acoustic</a> <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/folk-pop\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">folk-pop</a> journey through Kaplan's record collection and a virtual family tree of Yo La Tengo reference points. A wonderfully low-key collection of covers ranging from forgotten nuggets (<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Kinks</a>' &quot;Oklahoma U.S.A.,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Flamin%27+Groovies\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Flamin' Groovies</a>' &quot;You Tore Me Down,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Clark\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Gene Clark</a>'s &quot;Tried So Hard&quot;) to absolute obscurities (<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rex%2BGarvin%2B%2526%2BThe%2BMighty%2BCravers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Rex Garvin &amp; The Mighty Cravers</a>' &quot;Emulsified,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Escorts\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Escorts</a>' &quot;The One to Cry,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Scene+Is+Now\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Scene Is Now</a>'s &quot;Yellow Sarong&quot;), <em>Fakebook</em> also included a handful of outstanding new originals as well as luminous retakes of the previous record's &quot;Barnaby, Hardly Working&quot; and <em>New Wave Hot Dogs</em>' &quot;Did I Tell You?&quot; The superb &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - That Is Yo La Tengo EP\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/That+Is+Yo+La+Tengo+EP\" class=\"bbcode_album\">That Is Yo La Tengo EP</a>&quot; previewed 1992's &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - May I Sing With Me\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/May+I+Sing+With+Me\" class=\"bbcode_album\">May I Sing With Me</a>&quot;, the first effort to feature permanent bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/James+McNew\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">James McNew</a> (formerly of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Christmas\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Christmas</a>). A return to noise typified by the hot-wired nine-minute feedback saga &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Mushroom Cloud Of Hiss\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Mushroom+Cloud+Of+Hiss\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Mushroom Cloud Of Hiss</a>,&quot; the record balanced out its extremist tendencies with the occasional sidestep into melodic beauty (&quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Detouring America With Horns\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Detouring+America+With+Horns\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Detouring America With Horns</a>&quot;) and infectious <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20pop\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">indie pop</a> (&quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Upside-Down\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Upside-Down\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Upside-Down</a>&quot;).\n \n A move to the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Matador/\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Matador</a> label predated the release of 1993's &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Painful\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Painful\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Painful</a>&quot;, another winner informed by the atmospherics of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/shoegazer\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">shoegazer</a> drones and dream pop. Bookended by radically opposed renditions of the track &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Big Day Coming\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Big+Day+Coming\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Big Day Coming</a>&quot; -- the first an organ-driven mood piece, the other an edgy guitar outing -- the record pushed Yo La Tengo in a multitude of new directions, significantly expanding the trio's palette of sounds and textures. Released in 1995, &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Electr-o-pura\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Electr-o-pura\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Electr-o-pura</a>&quot; continued the progression, zigzagging from dead-on British Invasion re-creations (the sparkling &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Tom Courtenay\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Tom+Courtenay\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Tom Courtenay</a>&quot;) to shimmering <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/folk\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">folk</a> (the Hubley-sung &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Pablo and Andrea\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Pablo+and+Andrea\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Pablo and Andrea</a>&quot;) to bracing sonic experimentation (&quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Decora\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Decora\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Decora</a>&quot;). After 1996's &quot;<span title=\"Unknown album\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Genius + Love Equals Yo La Tengo</span>&quot;, a two-disc compendium of B-sides, compilation tracks, rare singles, and unreleased material, the trio resurfaced in the spring of 1997 with &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/I+Can+Hear+the+Heart+Beating+as+One\" class=\"bbcode_album\">I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One</a>&quot;; &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/And+Then+Nothing+Turned+Itself+Inside+Out\" class=\"bbcode_album\">And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out</a>&quot; followed in early 2000.\n \n The group also performed a three-night stint as the backing band for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Davies\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ray Davies</a> on his 2000 <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+States\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United States</a> tour, and in 2002 released &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - The Sounds Of The Sounds Of Science\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/The+Sounds+Of+The+Sounds+Of+Science\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Sounds Of The Sounds Of Science</a>&quot;, a soundtrack to the undersea documentaries of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/french\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">french</a> filmmaker Jean Painleve. That fall, they released the <a title=\"Yo La Tengo &ndash; Nuclear War\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/_/Nuclear+War\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Nuclear War</a> single, which featured several versions of Sun Ra's epic, and that winter performed their second annual Hanukkahpalooza, an eight-night musical festival at Hoboken, NJ's Maxwell's, which also featured a special limited-edition EP of Christmas songs. Yo La Tengo released &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Summer Sun\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Summer+Sun\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Summer Sun</a>&quot; in spring 2003, and that year Georgia Hubley performed in Mirror Man, an <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">avant-garde</a> <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20opera\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock opera</a> by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pere+Ubu\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pere Ubu</a>'s David Thomas. In 2005, Matador Records paid homage to the band's twentieth year as recording artists with the career-spanning compilation &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - Prisoners Of Love: A Smattering Of Scintillating Senescent Songs: 1985-2003\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Prisoners+Of+Love%3A+A+Smattering+Of+Scintillating+Senescent+Songs%3A+1985-2003\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Prisoners Of Love: A Smattering Of Scintillating Senescent Songs: 1985-2003</a>&quot;.\n \n 2006 saw the release of &quot;<a title=\"Yo La Tengo - I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/I+Am+Not+Afraid+Of+You+And+I+Will+Beat+Your+Ass\" class=\"bbcode_album\">I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass</a>&quot;, arguably the group's most 'eclectic' record yet.
